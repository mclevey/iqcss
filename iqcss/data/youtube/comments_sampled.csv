Persons resort to complicated rationales to defend their own desires; this was certainly the case here?  Matthew Vines, gay/homosexual caims to have been raised fundamentalist.  He says, He can can be a very good Christian, fruitful in God.  This is in direct conflict w the books of Romans , and Corinthians in Bible.  Both list those persons committing  homo sins, among others. definately not being in the hereafter. Matthew's father, apparently, did not know enough scripture, common enough for a reader, to advise him on this?  This likely gave the polite priest more assurance in the nec of Catholics to manage and interpret the Word for their parishiners?  This had been questioned by Martin Luther and beginning of protestant denominations to eliminate Vatican absolute authority and error in some teachings and practices. Gays claim they are just recipients of a nature bestowed by God; and therefore not their fault? Then the same could be claimed by those w any other desire or lust of the sinful nature, as they say?  Why not that of a person w the desire to rob a bank, or commit murder!  Hardly a pass in a crt of law?...Lib dem laws beginning in the 60s, and increasing lib society w their own sinful nature has come to agree as modern toleration, instead of willful rebellion to.commands and choice of the Creator, incl sex change, etc.,? Also ignored by all parties is the all important fact that of many successful accts and change as a result of counseling, just as that for any other impulse of the ""old sinful nature?"" This has naturally been suppressd by majority of society, like former Pres Obama, claiming the Constitution is outdated.  Gov DeSantis in Fl, in contrast, is passing laws and making changes to bring this state in line w the original intent of the Constitution, based on the principles of Judeo--Christianity, and especially his efforts to protect moral rights of children.

How many ancestors experiences do I incorporate in my genes.  Let’s assume that a new generation is born every 20 years. The purpose is to calculate all ancestors 2000 years backward. Let’s begin with simple calculation 200 years backward which means 10 generations backward. One generation back equals 1*2, two generations back equals 1*2*2, three generations back equals 1*2*2*2, ten generations back equals 2^10 = 1024 ancestors for 200 years back. In order to simplify calculations I round 1024 to 1000 or 10^3. Now let’s calculate ancestors backward 400 years which equals to 1000 * 1000, backward 600 years equals 1000*1000*1000, backward 2000 years equals 1000^(3*10) = 10^30. That means that all my ancestors backward 2000 years equals to the number 1 followed by 30 zeros!

What was the reward I wonder? Whether or not we are aware of it, once our brains begin learning and using that knowledge to gain what it wants, it's always seeking to improve it's ability to gain what it wants. Is that how the reward system is built into AI machine learning? For instance every time it successfully avoids an obstacle it gets a tiny boost to RAM and processing. Complete the entire task without a mistake and you get a significant bump in processing. If the machine understands that it's ability to improve is tied to it's ability to not make errors, would it push itself harder than usual? You woul think that would also have to be part of the code.

I also stand up for myself when I (in my opinion) am being criticized unfairly.  It seems that people often feel that I (and other HSPS) have somehow CHOSEN to be sensitive and why can't we just stop doing that. I am glad to hear that there is an upside.    It's certainly true that I have a tendency to overreact to stimuli, but it's exceedingly difficult for me NOT to.  I have also been told that I get defensive when friends or colleagues point out my mistakes, but from my point of view, it feels as though I'm being attacked.

Mass shootings, guns save more live in this country than they take, but how many news stories do you hear about that? Those type of stories rarely get told, because there's more advertising money in sensationalizing brutal murders. People in prison? They're there for a reason. Do you want all the drug dealers, rapist, pedophiles, and murderers released in your neighborhood? Student debt is only a problem for the people who get degrees in useless subjects where no one is hiring. Compare someone with a finance, or business degree, with someone with a degree in Latin literature, or philosophy. Racism, again liberal media incites racism on an almost daily basis. Without the media, you would rarely hear about racism in this day and age, unless the left uses it to further their agenda.And the ""Sup-Prime Mortgage Crisis"" of 2007- 2008? That was Barney Frank, and the Democrat controlled Congress that passed the banking laws which forced banks to give loans to people with no credit, and no money down. And as far as American bombs falling around the world , if the U.N. would step up and do what they were created to do, the U.S. wouldn't have to be the worlds police. Take Iraq for example, the U.N. issued thirteen separate resolutions against Iraq  for human rights violations, chemical weapons violations, refusing access to chemical and biological weapon sites for U.N. weapons inspectors. Then there was the genocide committed against the Kurds, the invasion of Kuwait to steal their oil, firing missiles at neighboring countries and at commercial aircraft. Everyone else was afraid of Sadam Husein, and what was then considered the third largest land army in the world. The U.S. fixed that problem, until Obama became president, and pulled the troops out before the region was stabilized.",Talks at Google,en,0.935982346534729

I’m binging on videos to support my transition because, unlike Nimai, I inherited a way of eating & remained ignorant ... I’ve starved myself of sufficient nutrients because, on one hand, I didn’t really know what to do but, on the other hand, I didn’t want to even look at an animal product ...So, videos like this & these self documented 12 week vegan transformations have really hit the core & inspired me.I know it’s controversial but one thing that pushed me over the edge was the heroes journey or heroic dose, rather.  Any “hippy” or, in my words, educated & compassionate person will understand what I mean.I guess I confronted & dissolved my own ego & felt the answer - the answer was unspoken, can’t be articulated, is not religious but ... the answer, amongst many things (like cannabis cessation), taught me that the way we eat is completely wrong.  I always knew it but I was blind & ignorant but ... I don’t know - it forced me to wake up & here I am.  I’m gonna do some real research re: what to eat.  I’m in shape but it’s not about shape.  It’s about optimal health & it’s not even about longevity (I don’t fear death), it’s more about enjoying the time spent on earth & I can’t do it anymore knowing that my own ignorance for my own convenience contributes to ethical problems that I detest.A bit of a tangent but ... if anyone has any good meal ideas, let me know.PS: he is so well spoken.

I have the unique opportunity toprovide students with a range of roles that they would never play in everydaylife and this in turn allows them to consider new thoughts and physicalbehaviours that they previously did not know they were capable of.Reflection and feedback is an important element of the process to help them grow.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.

They have to realise a lot of girls like it too - and also that he isnt real and is immature and immoral and these are not things you aspire to or think are worthy of bringing to real life. Even though Deadpool is meant to be an annoying, immoral, childish superhero I feel he still has responsibility to not mislead people, and guide to more progresseive thinking (I sound annoying but cant explain) and be more politcally correct at the same time - you know what i mean? i just dont want guys thinking they're better than everyone else.

I would like to speculate that as times passes, and the total amount of possible states increases, detail gets discarded because total information is finite. That's the materialist view of the entire universe. I even think most of the confusion comes from the fact that looking from our personal perspective (we are conscious parts of of this quanta), we also feel that information is finite but this time the total amount of possible states keeps decreasing while detail gets filled in. In other words our mind seems to merge repeatedly towards a more and more detailed picture, contrary to the universe which keeps branching and discarding.

It is not good for man to be alone so let me make him a woman. Males were created by God  for pairing with an ""other"" not a ""like"" of the same species. It's clear that God purposefully created distinct sexes, designed them for sexual pairing, and did so for a reason. The Bible says it's illicit copulation because God did not intend two males to be together. It degrades masculinity of males. Procreation is God's clue of telling us that the male penis and female vagina are complementary organs. Any union outside of male-female disregards the preservation of the human race. Male seed was given for a purpose. When it's ejaculated inside the sperm is searching for an egg to fertilize.  The penetration of a male was like treating him like if he were a female and there by emasculating him which was a major transgression. It's the deliberate  and exploitative feminization of the passive partner by the active partner. The passive partner already began the feminization process when he made himself ""available"" for the penis and sexual desire of the active partner.",Talks at Google,en,0.955351173877716

Furthermore it is my belief that legal action only serves as a band-aid solution to problems when no technical solution is immediately realized. Thus understanding that the underlying issue is the money influence within our political system, especially in the realm of campaign finance, my question then becomes what types of technical solutions can create the conditions under which money and its influence over our politicians is no longer relevant?To answer that question I am first inclined to ask another. In the age of information, where we have immediate access to all forms of media ranging from the written word to video representations, and where we have the proportionate ability to immediately distribute those same forms of media just as readily; All for little more than the price of a computer and a video camera. Why is it that the election process, In the hitherto mentioned age of information, requires so much money in the first place? Why is it so expensive to run a campaign?I find this question strikingly hard to answer. I can understand the cost associated with travel, of booking a venue and of buying a few billboards. But all these things seem to me to add up to a total that dwarfs in comparison to the amount of money these candidates accept in campaign contributions. There seems to be some fundamental disconnect, the campaign system is incredibly inefficient, and appears to be corrupting by its very nature.So then the question becomes, how can we implement recent advents of technology into the election process that would dramatically cut the cost of running for office?My answer:Create an open platform (.gov website) for candidates running for office to obtain campaign finance directly from the electorate. Candidates would post their political platform, their credentials, their past voting records, basically all information relevant for the public to make an informed decision. But here in my view is the interesting bit, every dollar contributed through this website can be tracked and represented in some sort of mathematical diagram and compared to the total amount received by the candidate for his/her campaign. If such a system were in place and were socially recognized as the authority in matters relating to a campaign, we would be able to see what groups have financed each politician. you would be able to see some thing like, this politician has received (x) amount of campaign dollars by undisclosed sources and (y) amount of campaign dollars by disclosed sources. From this you would be able to figure out what percentage of the total amount received comes from sources that are open about their motivations, which in essence would be a measure of how much you can trust a specific politician.The beauty in a solution like this is that it requires no reform on a legislative level. All that is required is a consensus be reached by the people to value openness and honesty in our political leaders.It seems to me that such a website if widely adopted by the public would create a platform that enables a politician to voice their ideas and explain their proposed policies for nearly no money at all, effectively restricting the influence money has over campaigns in the first place..........................................................I would greatly appreciate any feedback.",Talks at Google,en,0.9416322112083436

Does the method matter or is it only the result.  Does a system has to be aware of itself to be intelligent or is it already intelligent if it only mimics possessing awareness.One thing is no longer true in this lecture, he states (at timestamp 32:50) that we can not build an artificial brain because we do not now how the real brain works.  I did not realize this but that this statement is no longer true indeed enabled the actual simulation.  It is like building a plain, the plain does not have to use the same mechanism or technique to fly but it can only fly it if follows the same rules of physics and aerodynamics and it is only after you have these insights that you can replicate flying.  As with birds the biological brain has some things which are hard to do with a computer and so I did change and tweak the original but kept the principle of how thinking should be done.Replicating the flying of a bird I mean.I suspect that it is not the principle of the bioware brain that is hard to grasp but only the mere sheer complexity and amount of data involved and seeing through it.  So the actual insight comes not from IT and not even from neurobiology (which only learns us what the end-result is) put purely from embryology at a cellular and genetic level.  There is no method to build a living engineered being that can play robot other than to program that what constructs such a being and then, when the being is up to it, spend time on learning it to play chess (at which it will not excel because its circuitry is not optimized for that task, same like ours isn't).",Talks at Google,en,0.9737521409988404

What methods they both have are dodgy at best, and completely contradictory at worse. MC seems to understand this, but is reluctant to spell it out in clear terms, which is why he seems unsure as to exactly what ground he stands. Like Tom Campbell he seems to be reluctant to offend even more of his mainstream counterparts more then they already have. Unfortunately for truth, all scientists wish to remain in some kind of club, however much they seem to distrust its members, and above all patrons. Why don't more of these people simply acknowledge, quite how little they know, and still less they can be sure about? Answer; doing so would be like a plumber admitting that they don't know how to change a tap washer.  The pretensions of academia are as strong within the established, as they are within the alternative forms. The key to real knowledge is understanding how little you know. I suspect that the nature of our reality is actually very simple, only the pointless, and essentially useless details are complicated. Unfortunately academia, including theologists have a highly vested interest in making it all seem so incomprehensibly complicated. It sells books, and helps fill the proverbial collection plate, but has little to offer, the rest of humanity.",Talks at Google,en,0.9878842234611512

I think a more accurate example would be the following:Imagine that when you're walking to work you see a lake with 10000 children stuck. They are not drowning but they can't leave either. Saving any child can be done but it takes you time and energy. Are you morally obligated to save all of them, or at least save as much as you can before running out of energy? What if on the next day you find the same scenario, do you miss work again to save them? When you extrapolate the quantity of individuals that you can help, the issue becomes drawing the line of how many you should help. I sure believe that donating, especially when one is affluent, is a good deed and should be done by more people. But condemning those who don't donate is not the solution, as the line of how many people one should help will always be arbitrary.",Talks at Google,en,0.9788067936897278

All crisis would be much, much easier if we all had universal healthcare, tuition free education, internet for all and a UBI. It would be easier still if we all had home, business and covered parking rooftop solar arrays, electric vehicles, indoor, outdoor and vertical food gardens in every home, business, school, grocery store, restaurant, public park and land, etc and if more of us studied and worked remotely from home. #TooFarLeft #StillSandersPlatform #DEMEXIT Education is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example. Healthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons. A universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid. Internet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online. Solar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power. What do you think will happen to poverty, crime rates, forced migration, peace and equality in general after we launch a livable minimum wage, universal healthcare, universal education, universal basic income and universal internet, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we'll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? 😃 #EqualityMovement #BLM  Call me overly positive, but I think we’re leaving the era of ‘greed is good’ and celebrating wealth and entering an #EraOfAltruism and equality.

You are Gods child and forever will be, he loves you endlessly, don’t worry about your feelings, literally nobody knows the cause, maybe God did create different types of people, in the Bible it’s not confirmed or confirmed, no one knows, but let me tell you just put faith in him, everything happens for a reason, don’t worry about who you are, just live for him, And I mean LIVE FOR HIM, don’t care about what society says or thinks, you should only care about what God would say or think about you, he’s the only one who knows what’s in you and I mean by heart, I learned that I don’t need a partner to be happy, maybe God could bring me a special someone in the future, maybe not, he has a plan for each and every single one of us, and you know Jesus was a single man, and the world hated him. So just live for your father, be strong, keep reading the Bible, be you, don’t focus on finding what you want like love or lust etc. because what you want doesn’t mean that you need it, and God will only give you what you need at the right time, so keep the faith, live for him, (I know I’ve said that a bunch of times but it’s true) be thankful to him for being alive, don’t ask him for things, because he’s not a genie, he’s your father and he knows what’s best for you and he’ll give it to you when it’s the right time, and God wouldn’t like his child to be sad, be happy, be positive, everything’s going to be ok, and keep talking to him, he’s always listening, don’t focus on what society thinks right now, nobody knows the cause, some say they’re born with it, some say they’ve changed through God (and if that’s what you really want you could ask him) , others say it’s psychological, but really, nobody really knows if it’s good or bad, just God, so just keep the faith and don’t worry about your feelings, just focus on God and be strong, you can do this, ask him for help on your journey, I’m telling you, I’ve never been more happy in my life since I’ve had a relationship with him, he’s the best, just trust in him with everything, he really knows what’s best for you, so keep going!!

That choice is still available now, but will it be avaialble in 10 or 15 years?  Maybe, maybe not.  This also raises another interesting issue, it is not the airlines or the travel agents that are ""off-loading"" work to us, NEW businesses have cropped up to provide services where the old business was lacking.  Who needed a travel agent just to find a flight to go home for the holidays?  In that case all that is needed is the cheapest flight at the approriate time, something the online booking services do exceedingly well, and much better than the old way of travel agents or calling arilines directly.  So, I guess where I come down is, for routine matters that do not require brain work or a learned skill, we are better off with the electronic ways, but when a skilled person can truly add value or reduce the time needed to accomplish the end result, we are better off the ""old"" way.  In the case where value is truly added, one would have to believe that at least some part of the old business will survive if the value added is truly meaningful.  Two final points, the old adage of ""work expands to fill time"" might be a better concept for him to argue.  One can spend excessive time looking for a flight that is only 10% cheaper or only has a slightly better schedule, I've certainly done this myself . . . .  People need to beware of this and regulate themselves.  Second, maybe we are spending more time online doing things that we previously just would not have done because it simply was not efficient to do so (for example, I read local"" new stories about places where I used to live 3,000 miles away, just out of curiosity), and in so doing we are eating up the time that otherwise would have been spent with other people in the real world.

The same few voices heard over and over, the academics who create false legitimacy through papers and studies which are fed to the foot soldiers of their movement, the fake ""devs"", the ""cultural critics"", and the ""journalists"" who never check citations or the legitimacy of the basis of their views.  Why would they?  Just a quick search on youtube with the terms ""Anita Sarkeesian debunked in under a minute"" and you will find that person in their own words declaring both their ignorance of gaming and their status as a non gamer, and yet this is never mentioned by these people, like so much of the  inconvenient material which has been exposed, it is buried.  In proclaiming a new stage in gaming as pretentious art form they believe they can guide the medium by dictating what is acceptable.  Legitimacy is not important as they have achieved ideological hegemony, control in academia and the media, they control the message, and this is the result.  This talk at google is just yet a further example of their sway.Their criticisms about games, culture and society are laughable.  Citing the case of someone noticing that sometimes(very rarely) the people you are shooting at are arab?  This is Sarkeesian level cherry picking, in most cases you are shooting at aliens, space marines, Nazi's and only very occasionally arabs in games which are depicting wars in the middle east.  Outside of middle eastern war shooters, I can't remember the last time I saw a middle easterner as a villain.Do you know which group is actually most commonly shot at in games?  Men.  Men by the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.If these people really wanted equality, the would demand more women get shot in games.This probably doesn't feel right to anyone even if it is logically valid, but these people are sociological critics with blinders on, with a creationist level understanding of the human condition, so they would rather not understand why this is the case because on some level they know it is incompatible with their ideology.  From such blinkered perspectives, nothing of value can be had.  There is no integrity or substance, the people in this book, down the line there are problems too much to cover in a simple comment.  But it can be summed up with the example of Anita Sarkeesian, who is given a voice even now, when it is clear from video evidence that this person has no credibility at all.  Even if I granted that omission, her work speaks for itself as being intellectually vacuous trash which no one with a straight face could defend, especially if they actually dug up her citations.  Yet these are the people proclaiming themselves the new ""cultural critics"", aka the new arbiters of culture.  There is something very wrong with that, and because the veneer of credibility is so thin, these are the very types who have promoted censorship at every turn.  Critics who require an echo chamber are people who cannot win on their ideas alone.  This is the regressive left.  In the name of progressive politics they end up promoting the opposite. And because the starting point is always dishonesty, no valuable insights are to be had from such people.",Talks at Google,en,0.925998032093048

It's a decision that you make way before you arrive to the event. It happens when you're by yourself and are reflecting on your life. It happens the moment you decide to put 100% of what is inside of you on the outside. In other words, you stop living in your head. When you are fully visible to people, that is the beginning of charisma. Add to that a drive to be a lifelong learner, and you will have something to share with people and help them.  Charisma is not technique, but it's making your inner self visible and improving on that self so that it helps others. Bill Clinton would never have charisma just because he was ""present."" His charisma began long ago when he decided to try to change the world. It's what's in his head that makes him attractive, charismatic, not whether or not he is wiggling his toes to stay present.",Talks at Google,en,0.9542107582092284

You should also note that many of those 100,000 were already sick and would have died without any medical intervention as well.* I do not have an exact figure on it, because the alternative ""medicine"" quacks do not allow themselves to be studied.

Those scenes, the fillers of people eating breakfast before they go to school, of parents sitting down for a quiet glass of wine because the kids are finally asleep, don't have to exist at all. In lazy writing they're gap filler to pad out the dead space between major plot points. But they are important because they control the speed at which the plot progresses. Good writing makes them matter. Good writing takes those small scenes and ascribes significance to them in a way that pays off down the line because it fleshes out a character, or it gives you a piece of personality that, as the reader, you connect with, and it deepens your connection to the character. A good writer makes that doubly important by having the thing you connect to tie into the greater story. If you're reading things where it feels like 500 pages of nothing happens, I would suggest you find a different author, or perhaps look closer. Because that's what I love about Pat's writing: that nothing in wasted. Every sentence, every scene serves a purpose. That's good writing.",Talks at Google,en,0.9830028414726256

Humans when using their eyes are trained to focus on specific things as part of ""thinking or analysis"" of sensory input.   When children are taught to read they are taught to look at individual words one at a time in a sequence by focusing their attention on specific collections of printed characters in sequence.   Similarly, when humans see the world they focus on specific parts of that world based on what it is that they are doing.   Yes human eyes have the ability to see a wide variety of things within a large viewing angle, but in order for humans to make sense of that sensory information, they are typically trained to focus on specific pieces of that ""input stream"" of data.   Yes, the brain is able to multi task, but there is no evidence that the brain will ever be able to multi task like a computer.   A computer can analyze data in an image at a greater level of detail than a human can ever hope to be able to in theory.   For example, if I have two paragraphs of text in front of a persons face, it is doubtful that the human will ever be able to read both paragraphs and understand them at the same time the same way a computer would.   Our brains just don't work like that.That video of the sleuth or detective on a set where they constantly change things is a perfect example of simulating human focus.   But it is artificial.   Humans don't ""see"" like that in such a narrow field of vision.   But it does simulate how a person may focus on smaller parts of a larger scene.   Unfortunately in a situation like that, humans are only able to able to ""focus"" on limited amounts of data at a time without focusing on specific elements for a longer period of time.  But with the camera moving so much there is no way for the brain to capture enough to begin to detect what changes from frame to frame.  Not to mention humans will make assumptions in such a narrow field of view experiment about what will and wont change from any given frame to the next instead of reprocessing the whole thing.   This ""lazy loading"" or making assumptions about the environment based on learned assumptions and visual clues are the basis of sight gags. This is an example of where the physical biology of a human brain is fundamentally different from the physical structure of a silicon based computer program.",Talks at Google,en,0.9689424633979796

Corporations ALREADY ARE democratically operated. What do you think a BOARD OF DIRECTORS are and how did they get elected? How about the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Operation Officer(COO), Vice President of Finance (CFO), Vice President of Marketing, Vice President of Production, the Controller, the Cost Accounting Manager, the Credit Manager, the Cash Manager, etc,etc,etc.? Are they a static group of people or is their performance what defines THEIR SURVIVAL and job title? And you know what their labors are oriented towards, defined by, and ultimately held accountable by? Prices. Prices are a signal for free economic actors to attempt to profit off events, whereas Marxism (Under the materialist pretense) is a concept of designing a market in which outcomes are dictated by central authorities (Irrespective of the fact we say we are going to ""democratically elect the operators. All the operators of said economic organization fall under the  above stated positions and EACH maintain DIFFERING amounts of energy invested, differing amounts of specialization, differing amounts of skill, differing  creativity, differing industriousness, differing time invested, differing competencies, etc,etc, in essence, are defined down to the individual. Each INDIVIDUAL will wish to be compensated according to their skill set and what the market will bare. In effect, I don't think a Network engineer is going to take a deal where he is compensated for his added value to the organization at the same rate that a janitor is compensated. DIFFERENCE IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, INVESTMENT AND VALUE TO THE ORGANIZATION dictate his compensation vs the janitors)  Again, people of your naivety and business ignorance are EXACTLY what grand deceivers and agitators like Wolff need to allow for their nonsense to persist.

It is a biological fact that women must be treated more delicately for successful child birth and the continuation of the species, and that women hold a certain psychological dominance as gate keepers, which has historically been tempered by forcing men to be bread winners, as there are a plethora of examples of dominant women being quite terrifying in the anecdotal record. The issue at hand, i believe, is the inability of most to recognise these facts. Once recognized they can be set aside for important issues with sarcasm and wit, but while outrage culture denies their ability to be stated, their trueness intensifies their problamatic nature. Perfect Example: SOPH being booted from the YouTube Platform. Understanding does not come from denial or censorship, rather reasoned discourse. I place primary fault with unsupervised rote algorythmic removal of information, implicit platforming of virtue signaling rabel rousers, false politeness, political correctness, and unaknowleged subconscious bias.

Consequently, the concentrations of those enzymes, substrates, coenzymes and cofactors determine the rate at which the biochemical reactions take place. Dopamine biosynthesisParkinson's Disease is primarily due to the insufficient biosynthesis of dopamine. The primary methods of treating Parkinson's Disease are based on this fact. So when the enzymes, substrates, coenzymes and cofactors required for dopamine biosynthesis are deficient the biosynthesis of dopamine is greatly reduced. The insufficient biosynthesis of dopamine causes Parkinson's Disease.EnzymesEnzymes enable biochemical reactions to take place. Almost all biochemical reactions require an enzyme for the biochemical reaction to be completed. The level of activity of the enzyme determines the rate at which the biochemical reaction occurs. However, unless the enzymes have genetic errors, which is a rare occurrence, the enzymes will be present.In people with Parkinson's Disease, the activity of the enzymes required for dopamine biosynthesis are substantially reduced, to very low levels in some people [1-6]. However, the activity of the enzymes can be greatly increased with the use of the substrate, coenzymes, and cofactors for those enzymes [7-15].SubstratesThe substrate is the substance on which an enzyme acts. The substrate bonds with the enzyme active site, and an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. The substrate is transformed into one or more products, which are then released from the active site. The biosynthesis of dopamine requires only one substrate for its formation, which is L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine is essential for the biosynthesis of L-dopa via the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase [7-10]. The quantity of L-dopa formed increases or decreases according to the concentration of L-tyrosine [7-10].CoenzymesA coenzyme is a chemical compound that is essential for the biochemical activity of many but not all enzymes. The activity of the enzyme increases or decreases according to the concentration of the coenzyme. Most coenzymes are ultimately derived from vitamins. The biosynthesis of dopamine requires four coenzymes : pyridoxal phosphate, tetrahydrofolic acid, NADPH, and NADP. Pyridoxal phosphate is essential for the formation of dopamine from L-dopa. Tetrahydrofolic acid is essential for the biosynthesis of L-dopa from L-tyrosine. Dopamine biosynthesis requires tetrahydrofolic acid, which requires NADPH, and pyridoxal phosphate, which requires NADP. Pyridoxine is essential for the biosynthesis of pyridoxal phosphate [16, 17].  Folic acid is essential for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid [18-21]. Nicotinamide is essential for the biosynthesis of the nicotinamide coenzymes NADPH and NADP [22-34].CofactorsA cofactor is a chemical compound that is essential for the biochemical activity of many but not all enzymes. The activity of the enzyme increases or decreases according to the concentration of the cofactor. Most cofactors are mineral elements such as manganese and zinc.The biosynthesis of dopamine requires three cofactors : ferrous iron, zinc, and manganese. Ferrous iron is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of L-dopa from L-tyrosine [7-10]. Zinc is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of pyridoxal phosphate, which is essential for the formation of dopamine [16, 17]. Manganese is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of NADP and NADPH, which are essential for dopamine biosynthesis [27-34]. MalnutritionEven partial deficiencies of the substances that are necessary for dopamine formation will cause a reduction in dopamine biosynthesis [7-10]. The deficiency of more than one substance required for dopamine biosynthesis multiplies the detrimental effect on dopamine biosynthesis [7-10].Up to 60% of people with Parkinson's Disease are at risk of malnutrition, and therefore the risk of not just partical deficiencies but serious deficiencies of the nutrients required for the biosynthesis of dopamine [35-41, 57]. The prevalence of serious malnutrition in people with Parkinson's Disease is as much as 25% [35-39, 42, 57]. Severe malnutrition occurs in about 2% of people with Parkinson's Disease [35, 36]. The prevalence of malnutrition in people with Parkinson's Disease worsened over time and was in relation to the severity of Parkinson's Disease [39].DeficienciesL-tyrosine is essential for the formation of dopamine. It is normally obtained in the diet in the form of protein. However, most people with Parkinson's Disease have a significantly lower protein intake [43, 44], and therefore a lower intake of L-tyrosine. Parkinson's Disease is also associated with the deficiency of all of the other substances that are essential for dopamine biosynthesis including zinc [45-50], iron [51, 52, 58], manganese [53], folic acid [44, 54, 55], nicotinamide [54, 56], and pyridoxine [54, 56].",Talks at Google,en,0.960466742515564

We have a much better idea of how it works and the brain modulates all pain experiences. You can learn pain, and you can also unlearn it. Not all pain is the same– sometimes you actually need some time to heal or intervention, but sometimes pain persists even when it shouldn't, hence the learned part. Honestly, just watch the whole thing. Pain education has been enough to reduce or eliminate symptomology for some people, including myself. Others need additional tools like he mentions.

The event speakers should be individually closely miced. Their mics should go to a mix for sound reinforcement and a seperate mix for the event recording. The microphone preamps should be set so that no clipping occurs. EQ and compression can be used on the mix used for the event recording to improve intelligibility. Better yet do a multitrack recording of each mic channel for post event mixdown. Camera / room mics should not be used to record primary dialog because of reduced intelligibility due to the added room reverberation in the signal. They should not be included in the event mix unless someone in the audience is asking a question.,Talks at Google,en,0.990614891052246

It's a 40 year old concept. ""Culture infects the mind"" is his way of talking about memes. The other problem is that I always thought the meme is a wrong and misleading concept. Dawkins had only one interesting idea in his life which was the selfish gene (if he even came up with it). That was in 1976. Since then he created nothing and now he decided to fight the idea of God. Has Daniel Dennet based the last 40 years of his life on the wrong and silly idea of the meme? Ideas don't have a life of their own. Beings use ideas that fit their needs for their benefit, not for the benefit or the survival of the idea. I fast forwarded about 90% of the talk so that I wouldn't die of boredom.

For starters, the operators who spout this shit about ""quiet professionalism"" only say it because they had uneventful careers where they have no stories of their own to tell. Next, and most importantly, the top brass only encourages silent professionalism to make their own jobs easier by never having to be called to Capitol Hill to answer for some of the methods special forces use, and the extent of how much of a black budget these units actually receive each year. Shit that would make the public squeamish, and the politicians wanting to start doing further investigation into special forces funding to account for annual spending. The books and speeches given by former SEALs are the individual stories and lived experiences of these men. The govt doesn't own that. I also don't want to hear anything about publicly unmasking revealing our tactics when US special forces groups were doing joint training exercises with Spetsnaz and China up until about 10 years ago, since they were technically our allies during that time. The true danger comes in politicians leaking shit to the press, and embedded turncoats working inside the govt as intelligence operatives for other nations. Guys like Rob O'Neill, Chris Kyle, and Jocko Willink are a net positive for society.You'd have to be the biggest, most brainwashed tool in the world to be the guy who killed Osama bin Laden and remain anonymous for the rest of your life.

It is very common.  On a sidenote when the kid at 18:36 cut sideway in the videoclip i was shocked to see that. That is not how a lesson prepares kids to use knifes and then let them actually handle it. I guess it was well meant, but executed shitty as hell. And that is the real problem, not that kids learn it or are prohibited or to say the germans make it better than the americans. It is that adults aren't in the know how to teach save handling, because they never got told themself in the right way or are to stupid to use common sense to prepare the teaching. What was common within families to teach is nowadays school business and the teachers have no F** clue how to teach it, since they only learned the next psychological clap trap in how to manipulate kids the best way maslow style. And the outcome of the shitty teaching of teachers is this footage.  Lighting candles or better to say the 4 candles on the weekends towards christmas not the tree itself. I didn't asked to do it, had no particular interest in it if my memory serve me correctly. However if i would have asked my parents would have allowed me to do so. The ""Stockbrot"" experience with an open fire place I had too. However I had it on one of my first class trips in the 5th or 6th grade... But then again this was early 90s. It might have progressed into earlier childhood years, as did many other things that have been propagated to influence childs as early as possible. And to make it a circle. First experience with open fire was grilling with charcoal, what is pretty common in germany in the summer time. This was early as i was eight years i think, when my father let me light it up and control it to get it ready for the actual grilling action. Compared that to the US where you have smokers nowadays which are ""closed"" and the way to grill hamburger i guess they are more protective and don't see this event as a chance to introduce handling of fire to their children. This makes the difference when I think about it. We give kids the opportunity while teaching them what to do, how to do and what to avoid and the why it is danagerous, while in the us it is prohibited until you have the legal age. Spring break at least as it is portrait via media is pretty much the outcome of such a culture. Contact with alcohol is in germany a no brainer.. Kids may take a sip on the adults beer as early as 7 to 10 years of age. They taste it is bitter and may than not think about it untill the early teens, when they slowly get introduced into the adult culture, since they stay up longer into the evening. And pretty much to their Communion or Jugendweihe they have first time more or less supervised contact with alcohol, if it ain't had happend earlier. It is growing up into it, but not a now you can feel free to legally alcohol poison yourself to see the consequences of your actions thing.",Talks at Google,en,0.9918609857559204

I'm an engineer and I clearly understand there has to be an even number of cogs, but from a graphical design perspective even numbers of cogs just don't work visually and aesthitically, and as an engineer who designs buildings, I'd add that evens don't work well architecturally.  Symmetry works well in architecture of course, but symmetry about the half grid (with an odd number of grids in total) always works so much better.  You only have to look around you in the world to understand this.  In mathematics evens are cool and simple, beacause they are recurring, and that's why we like them, but in the in the real world evens stink.  I would add that numbers don't actually exist in the universe, only on Earth because we invented them to help us understand our world.  In a far off planet, alien species will not have numbers in the way we see numbers, they will have measures of intensity of course, but they won't be decimal, they will most likely be based on a local stellar or luna cycle (like ours are) or they will be based on another system we can't begin to comprehend.  I'm not dismissing in any way the power of mathematics, I love maths, it's a fantastic science we could not live without, which all other sciences rely on.  Going back to the original discussion, why is a 4 leaf clover so rare ?  because nature only works in odd numbers. In any image of a flower, you will only ever see an odd number of petals.  A 4 leaf clover is such an oddity, and because it's so rare, only happens now and again, like one in a million, and the fact that you never get a patch of 4 leaf clovers together, it can only be put down to a genetic diversion which cannot reproduce. In summary, I know shit, most of us know shit, we pretend through mathematics that we understand the Earth, our Solar System, the Milky Way, the Universe.... but do we really ??  mathematics and physics for that matter is all conjecture, it can never be anything other, we will never know.",Talks at Google,en,0.9888333082199096

I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, stage 4 when I was 74. I had always lived a very energetic life, raising four kids, moving from country to country. I did my usual researching when I started on my cancer journey, following links on line, reading medical studies, talking to people etc.  Then I began to follow the advice of my consultant and oncologist. I had a simultaneous resection of the bowel & liver. (There were two tiny tumours, which they completely removed) I am/was a pretty healthy strong person and went through the 6 hour surgery well. I recovered without any problems. Then they began to talk to me about chemo. I was not keen on the advice, feeling instinctively against the thought of the poisonous chemicals (FOLFOX) after talking to doctors and professionals I agreed to have 12 infusions of the chemo. I was seen after each infusion of the chemo by the consultants to check my reaction to the dosage.  At no time did anyone speak to me of LYMPHODEMA, ever. I was given lots of details about other after effects of my treatment, but nothing about Lymphodema.  I am a patient who always asks questions, many questions, always, so I cannot understand why this was not brought to my attention. I live in London, and the hospital and consultants I saw were described as “World Class”.  When both my legs started to swell enormously and hurt, I bought this to my consultants attention. The remarks I received were: “sorry I don’t do legs”, “do you realise that ten years ago you would not have survived this operation, we saved your life!” No one seemed to take me seriously. I became invisible. This was all made worse by the fact that the pandemic started, and in London, most hospitals stopped doing their usual treatments. So I was left, in remission, with swollen, painful legs which greatly affected my mobility and the way I looked. I became very depressed and had no one to contact. So I turned to the internet (“Dr Google”) After days of searching I found Dr. Gordon Rockson. It was amazing listening to him talk about his experience in the US. Then I found Kathy Bates and LEARN. I found one private clinic in the UK called “The Lymphodema Clinic”  which was in Oxford. So I called them and got an appointment to see their consultant. At a huge cost I travelled to see them and was examined by a consultant. But he told me that he didn’t think I had Lymphodema. He said that Lymphodema did not cause pain. He told me that he had no treatments that would help me. If you check out his website “The Lymphodema Clinic” you will see all the procedures he lists. But, because he thought I did not have Lymphodema, he said they would not be suitable for me. I was so disappointed. I have tried many times to get help in the UK, but no one seems to know how I can get help. I have spent money I really can not afford to no avail. I’ve even thought of trying to visit Stanford teaching university, but I’m a retired woman living on my own with a small income. I’m 81 this year and I’ve lost so much of my life, unable to do the things I’ve always loved; painting, photography, playing with my grandkids. I had stopped looking for help but every now and again I see things like this on YouTube and become angry and frustrated at all my loss. I know that the doctors think that they’ve “cured” me, but at what cost?  Diana DEEKS.",Talks at Google,en,0.9784401655197144

Unfortunately, Noam Chomsky tends to focus one-sidedly on blaming Israel rather than seeking peaceful resolutions to a complex situation brimming with intense hatred and fear.  For years his rhetoric points the finger at Israel as well as the United States where he sits in his ivory tower watching needless death and destruction when the Middle East should be a mecca of ancient diverse cultures, arts, science, and cuisines with everyone living and thriving together.    Unfortunately, many people embrace Noam’s words believing he’s an intellectual based on his encyclopedia-like mind, brandishing facts, figures, and buzz words that can paint any group as monsters.  Most unfortunately, Noam is Jewish, granting extra credence to anti-Israeli sentiments: “You see, even this Jewish scholar is saying Israel is totally at fault.”   Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Einstein were intellectuals; capable of keeping an open mind with empathy for all viewpoints.  Noam does not exhibit these attributes.  The cultural historian Sander Gilman has written, “One of the most recent forms of Jewish self-hatred is the virulent opposition to the existence of the State of Israel.”  Perhaps Noam is a self-hating Jew.

Unassailable, yet powerfully capable of assailing enemies. Profoundly competent, yet understated and unpretentious. Just, honest, genuine, courageous and magnanimous, yet capable of being ruthless when the situation warranted. To my mind, these are the hallmarks of the 'True Scythian', that most ancient root of the Indo-European people that proceeded to branch out across the known world and subsequently become known as an endless variety of peoples and nations over time. I've purposefully used the oldest and most broad definition of 'Scythian' throughout this video, that mentioned at 4:00, lumping many of their obvious direct outgrowths into the umbrella term. The more I dig, the more the dividing lines between peoples fall away, and the more its possible to understand the central spoke of the wheel of the 'PIE' (Proto-Indo-European) people, and the 'True' Scythians are very representative of this seed from which so much would later grow.  Think of history in the manner of waves radiating outwards (and back inwards) from a central point around the black sea, and firm caste structures developed in its wake, and history immediately begins to make a great deal more sense.  There's still a great deal I'm not saying, and haven't yet touched upon, especially with regards to Scythian 'origins', and I hope you'll all be a bit patient in this regard. As I mentioned before, picture this series as an attempt at a spiral towards truth, each rotation drawing a bit nearer, the totality of context a bit clearer, and further building the contextual puzzle.   Apologies for not giving details to support each minor point. I'm trying to cover such a broad swathe of time and events that these videos would be 10+ hours long were I to delve into the specifics and supporting evidence, but I try to only to give voice to what I can be relatively certain is true. (It'll add a bit of time/effort to the equation, but in the future I think I'll cite lists of sources used) Many others do the piecemeal analysis of details and specifics, I'm taking this path because I feel there's both a need and appetite for it, but I strongly encourage others to do their own research... and in fact this is probably the foremost goal of my creating these videos. I very much want to launch other intensive research journeys. As I mentioned in my recent message to subscribers, I can't thank you enough for supporting the work and future projects... it was just enough at just the right time to save me from a rather tricky situation, and I'm forever grateful.

You have clearly never been in a board room. The omnipresent lawyer will constantly point out which laws and regulations have to be paid attention to. There are very few corporations these days that are not trying to be kitchen clean in the way they do business. The consequences are just too severe. Not only that, but it's much easier and much cheaper to abide by the law than to circumvent it. So, no, the idea that corporations are successful because they know how to skirt the law is completely wrong. Corporations love regulations. Why? Because they make the barrier of entry for new startups very high. It is much easier to work with the law within an established operation than it is to achieve compliance with the law from scratch in a newly set up entity.

And we learn such bite-sized chunks of tonal syntax that while practising there is no cognitive effort (no working-out). But intention and meaning are there from the very beginning. Yes, we work to allow our natural rhythm to drive the story-telling metre in improvisation and do not follow judging thoughts about the Results, but the mind always knows where our fingers are and the body knows where we are in the structure of the rhythmic matrix. Maybe there's more meat in Kenny's method and this talk doesn't do it justice.

Dangers are more .. dangerous? Ask the dinosaurs. Dangers are ever-present, extinction is always around the corner, the difference is that we are in control of extinction mechanisms and not the random asteroid. This ,imo, is an improvement. Even World War 3 will leave us in a better situation than whatever cataclysm that left only several thousand Humans alive. Climate change? Its not the first time it happens. We are the cause? Well, that means that we are in control, does it not? Which is an improvement compared to numerous species that went poof in previous climate changes.  By the way, apparently i agree with him, the world and the universe are destined to get better, but it is hardly relevant to this video ,he did not claim it here.I compared 1800s to 2000s only to show that things are indeed getting better. Roman empire had no feminism, mind you. Average life expectancy was very low. There were slaves. Now, after it crashed and burned world was worse of, but after some time it became a lot better. Western civilization is not going to last to eternity, and i suspect that things will become temporarily worse after it crashes. But eventually, things will be lot better than it is now. That does not mean that things will be perfect nor that the challenges Humanity will face in the future will be minor ones, the opposite. Expansion of the universe into oblivion is a nice challenge that some intellect will have to face, climate change compared to it is like lack of salt in the economy. A serious problem for Romans, btw.",Talks at Google,en,0.9155412316322328

My husband looks over to me and whispers, ""Marriage..."" doing the voice from the priest in the movie, and I lost it. I started laughing and could not stop. It was so, so inappropriate but hilarious. People giving us dirty looks because once I started laughing he started laughing.

Except that in bad times those assets depreciate, or lose a good part of their value which means the companies or banks get far less than was previously agreed or the bank pays out at distorted high valuations, i.e. at a loss.  It could be argued that if the  BoE buys at a lower price its bagged itself a bargain and just has to wait for the price to return to its normal evaluation, but if, in  a prolonged recession /depression its not possible to wait for prices to rise it would mean the BoE would have to write off these loans putting the BoE in a precarious position of going bust itself.

The Bible and traditional Christian theology teach that the logos is the Divine self expression of God, and himself also co-equal and co-internal with God, and therefore also God the same and yet distinct. The beginnings of trinitarian theology. In patristic text the Holy Spirit is seen as having an actualizing role in creation. So that the father is consciousness  that brings forth the logos, or information, which is interpreted and brought to realization by the Holy Spirit. In the creation narrative found in the Book of Genesis, we have the spirit of God seen as hovering over the primordial Waters, at which point God speaks, or communicates information if you will, and the world is created. The logos is like a wave-function state, and the Holy Spirit is like consciousness or measurement that brings about wave-function collapse to produce a definitive reality. So even in Christianity the world is made of information, interpreted by and proceeding forth from consciousness. In this case Jesus Christ, the incarnate logos is seen as human incarnation of the fundamental information from which the universe is brought into existence.",Talks at Google,en,0.95309579372406

Without Bezos they would be unemployed, or would have a shittier job, with shittier pay, and the rest of the population would not be able to enjoy the services of Amazon.The moment you penalize Bezos, or hypersuccessful people, they will turn their talent and time towards something else. In the end, the greatest loser of that penalty will be small fry everyday joes who are too dumb to run a successful business.And make no mistake. Most of the work in any team or company or workplace is done by a hypercompetent minority. Nature is not big on equality. Some of us are born with exceptional intelligence, force of will, stubbornness, curiosity, cooperative skill, and some of us go to great lengths to hone our abilities, or stick with problems for longer, or work harder, etc.Compared to a bottom feeder of Mensa, the average joe is mentally retarded, has a childlike grasp on the world and is completely unable to execute cognitive tasks that an entry level Mensa member can do as easily as breathing.

Nor were they innocent/exonerated by DNA evidence... you can simply go back and watch their testimonies along with the 28 other boys if you are confused about that.1. Female blood similar to the joggers on 2 of the boys shoes.2. DNA had just begun to be used as evidence 6 months before this case so police were not trained how to keep a crime scene pristine back then.3. 2 of the boys had female genital pubic hair on them that matched the jogger.4. 3 of the boys had semen in their underwear.5. The boys were not beaten to get a confession out, they weren't starved either, the questioning wasn't harsh or manipulative (it's on video), the parents were also IN THE ROOM!6. There were 95 witnesses that testified... most were eye witnesses but there was also Melody Jackson, whose brother was friends with Korey Wise, she testified that she talked to Wise by phone when he was at Rikers Island and that he told her that he didn't rape the jogger, he ""only held her legs down while Kevin (Richardson) f*cked her. He only felt her breast"" She originally volunteered this information to the police thinking it would be helpful to Wise. The boys admit to beating her and sexually molesting her. We even know exactly which boys held her down. The only question is if any of the boys entered her while they were holding her down feeling her up. We know how many boys had their penises out and humping her... the question is did they go inside of her. Each boy tells on the others but no boy admits to entering her. They took turns but none of the boys admitted to watching the other to see if the penis entered... they just assumed since the boys were humping, that they were inside.7. Reyes confessed to doing all of it alone after he got beat up by Korey Wise, who had become a blood prison gang leader. You can read the prison report regarding the fight.Reyes had absolutely nothing to lose by confessing to the rape, the statute of limitations had run out already, he had much to gain by claiming he acted alone: He got a favorable prison transfer. He was already in prison for murder.Police always knew a 6th boy had gotten away. Listen to the five boys testimony they mention Reyes walking up mid way thru the assault.There's also a report from a former cellmate of Mattias Reyes before he was transferred. He said Reyes told him he showed up at the end and took Trisha to another location to rape her again1/11/02 - Reyes filed a request for Separation from General Population stating he ""Feared for his life"" an investigation was launched by Officer Clark and was confirmed later in 11/12 by Captain Gummerson at Auburn Correctional Facility, who confirmed that Reyes was in danger if he remained in the general population alongside Korey Wise.In the book ""Your Eyes Your Life"" by Richard Siracusa, he writes ""The panel suggested that there investigation revealed evidence that Reyes came forward as a result of threats delivered through the underground prison communication system and/ or he acted in order to get a desired change in prison assignment""8. When Raymond Santana was being driven to the precinct the night of the rape, he blurted out: ""I had nothing to do with the rape. All I did was feel the woman's tits.""None of the boys knew if the female jogger survived the attack and some assumed she had died. Police didn't even know about the rape at that point so he volunteered that info. The other boys were only found because the first boy who got arrested gave all the names and where to find the other boys to the police... which is how we know who was involved.The group of more than 30+ boys planned to go ""wilding"" two days prior. They intended to come to Central Park and beat up random people and possibly rob them.They beat 7 people that night. One man they beat with a metal pipe and almost killed him. They fractured his skull.9. Up until 2002 Raymond Santana was saying that he had done everything else except the rape, Yusef Salaam said the same thing. They changed their story after the publicity. A great video breaking it down... for anyone curious.https://youtu.be/qYFBRbkzWS4Sperm present on underwear: Antron McCray Kevin Richardson Raymond SantanaHead and pubic hair: Kevin Richardson Steve LopezHuman blood: Yusef Salaam Raymond SantanaSarah Burns Documentary + The Netflix ""When They See Us""Sarah Burns the person behind the ""When They See Us"" Netflix Documentary also worked for the same law firm that was trying to get them a big $40 million settlement from NYC. Hence the one sidedness and ignoring facts /evidence from the film.The Netflix show ""When They See Us"" is ""biased"" and ""Completely Slanted"" per the Creator and writer of the show Ava DuVernay. Which explains the blatant lies like when the officer hits Kevin Richardson in the face with an officers motorcycle helmet... when in reality no officer had a helmet or even a motorcycle. Nor did he have a black eye in real life like he did in the show... they created an insanely inaccurate portrayal to control the viewers perception of what actually happened. You can still look at the booking photo of Kevin Richardson so it's not like she didn't know this....You can see Ava DuVernay's interview where she admits her show was ""Completely Slanted"" and ""Biased"" here.....http://centralpark5.com/category/the-documentaries-and-the-netflix-serieshttps://youtu.be/wO_kb08z49cThe boys' sentences were commuted, they were never declared innocent because they clearly aren't. They served their time for the assault but we don't need to lie about them being innocent as it's not helping anyone.",Talks at Google,en,0.9374727010726928

Like solving a pest problem in a house by burning the house. I've heard opinions that the white anti-racism movement just increases the awareness of race and may have the effect of making racism worse. Basically, you tell a person, ""be anti-racist, be anti-racist!"" But it might have the side effect of making the person even more racist. I think the better approach is to not highlight the racism itself, but to highlight values such as just seeing people as equal at first and later judging them  based on their actions. Justice is not reversing the ""oppression"" or trying to force equal outcomes for all. It's just helping people find the security they seek in life. It can also be done by addressing the and encouraging culture change, but not in the sense of the ""cultural revolution.""",Talks at Google,en,0.953194260597229

There's no doubt that MSRs are safer than PWRs: MSRs will automatically shut down when power is cut off. That's great. But nobody has one working at scale yet. The Chinese have been working on this problem for years, and so far, there isn't a commercial scale solution. But it's too late, nuclear had its chance, and the people of this world are terrified of Fukushima and Chernobyl, so that's it for nuclear power. The stigma attached to nuclear can't be undone, and it shouldn't be: years later, we still haven't contained Fukushima, and we may never be able to contain it.

Balance and fairness is not important; what is paramount is success and money; the American Gods. I was a social worker in barrios and ghettos where you would find real tragedy and real pain. The McCandles family, from all accounts, had much opportunity and material richness. Indeed they mention the vacations including the trip to Europe. Indeed Chris graduated with high grades from a good university. You know raising a family and living in a consumer driven, materialistic world like American has become, is very difficult and everyone makes mistakes but as Mark Anthony said, people remember only the bad, for “the good is interred in their bones”. It is almost impossible to not make mistakes raising a family. I am sure that one day, the daughter of Bill Gates will write the true story of how bad he was and abusive and un loving and how lonely she was and how her drug problems are due to her childhood.

Let’s put aside “phenomenal consciousness” and focus on your claim that there is no physicalist explanation for memory formation and recollection, which even Chalmers would consider well within the range of the “easy problems.” First, let me say that you are simply wrong that neuroscience currently has nothing to say about memory. We have been learning quite a lot about the neuroplasticity of brains and how new connections can be formed between neurons which allow you to learn and store information about past experiences.But let’s just disregard all of that scientific work for the sake of argument and start from the assumption that neuroscience hasn’t (yet) figured out anything about memory. What would it mean for memory to be a nonphysical process? When somebody is making a report of a past experience we can observe that certain muscles in their speech apparatus are contracting in specific ways to produce vibrations in the air. I hope that you can at least agree that no nonphysical properties need to be postulated to explain any of this. Now we can go back the causal mechanism and look for something that caused those muscle contractions. One way that we could discover the immateriality of memory would be if we simply found no further cause of these contractions, they just happened spontaneously without any further explanation. This is a testable hypothesis. If we found that this is how reports of NDEs worked, the case would be closed. I don’t believe any reasonable person would endorse such a view, and, in fact, we know that that’s not how it works. The muscle contractions which form a speech act are caused by chemical signals which are themselves the result of electrical spike trains (action potentials) which travel down efferent nerve fibers. Another way in which the nonphysicality of memory could be proved would be if these electrical spike trains simply appeared out of nowhere in the nerve fibers. Again, this is a testable hypothesis and it’s not what we’ve discovered. All these nerve fibers which control the muscles in your speech apparatus can be traced back to the brain, specifically to the motor cortex. This is where things get a little bit more complicated, obviously. Maybe this is the place where the immaterial soul intervenes to spontaneously create electrical signals which carry the information of the memory? Again, that should be testable, at least in principle. There’s actually more tracing back that can be done from this point, but I think you get the point. Wherever you posit that the immaterial soul ultimately delivers the recollection to the physical body in order for it to be expressed, there would have to be an observable miracle at that point.So, where do you posit that such a miracle will be discovered? For Descartes it was the pineal gland, which we now understand is just a place where hormones are produced. Whatever your answer, there is no way to weasel yourself out of some point of interaction between the physical body and the immaterial soul if you want memory to be immaterial and still produce observable effects in the physical body.I can tell you with certainty that there aren’t a lot of scientists (or even philosophers) who believe that such a miracle will ever be discovered or will in any way be necessary to explain memory.

Constantly reassessing the goals of acquiring new information lets you dig deeper in understanding and hence remembering;4. ""Remembering memory.""

Acquired information gets deteriorated within a very short period of time (50% gets lost the next day). Dealing with information again prolongs its stay in the brain;6. ""Find relationships.""

Less anthropocentric understandings of time and causality get rid of the logical problems it presents...""Oh really? Do tell, make sure you define whatever deity you are apologizing for, because if I see the common 'free will' bullshit, when referencing an entity supposedly synonymous with good and all powerful, you know I'm going to shut you down on the logical incongruity therein. So if the entity you profess to believe in has properties at odds with it's very existence, that entity does not exist.If you claim a deity (Christianity and Islam) that has omni-benevolence omnipotence and omniscience, then obviously you have to account for evil as manufactured, supported and preordained by such a deity. ""There's a reason that anytime you see a theist philosopher debate against Harris or Hitchens or what have you that the atheist is always bringing up evil, and the theist is always bringing up metaphysics, and the two just dance around each other.""You haven't seen a lot of Hitchens' or Harris' debates then. Debate topics have a lot to do with the subjects and arguments brought up in them. Theists will invariably talk metaphysics as whenever the going gets tough, just make some shit up."" Both perspectives have their stomping grounds wherein they are persuasive and respectively each have their fields in which they are unpersuasive.""Nonsense, even in philosophy there is that which can be proved to be true and that which can be asserted as true, without proof. When I say a being with omnibenevolence and omnipotence cannot exist in our reality, this is a testable claim.

The government can provide better laws, taxation systems, skills, and education,   workers by having better equal pay, bonuses, dividend, and say in decision making then these factors will inspire workers to be more productive, efficient and do everything to make the business competitive dynamic and successful.   investors can get the best of all world by having the support of the gov.as business partner which help to protect the business and create markets and promote business within and abroad. investor get the value for money that invested by having workers as partners and it by itself add value efficiency productivity and resilience to the business model.  overall this business economic model creates synergy and much-needed support for each of these 3 partners.  each partner can add to innovations and dynamism from their own capacity and resources.  it will create happy equal sustainable jobs and the gov and investors will have highly committed professional and productive and competitive business.   for example, the nation's natural resources, human resources and capital and assets all can be fully used for the benefit of the nation, government, people and businesses.    ALSO,I SUGGEST THAT MONETARY SYSTEMS MUST BE BACKED BY GOOD CREDITS SCORE SYSTEMS THAT INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS,  BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS CAN GIVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SCORES TO EACH OTHER BASED ON UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED POINTS THAT COULD INCLUDING THE ROLE OF THAT PERSON, POLITICIAN, GROUP, ORGANISATION BUSINESS, GOVERNMENT ETC ON RECORDS OF CAUSING OR PREVENTING:  (FAWAD CHARKHI)WAR AND PEACE,  RECORDS OF DESTRUCTION OR DEVELOPMENT,  RACISM AND EQUALITY, JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE, RECORDS OF LIES AND TRUTH, WORKING FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE TO OFFER EDUCATION- HEALTH- DEVELOPMENT- ENVIRONMENT- SUSTAINABILITY- POLLUTION- ETC.

POSITIVE CREDIT SCORE COULD BE TRANSFORMED AS MONEY PER GOOD CREDIT SCORE AND IF THE CREDIT SCORE GIVEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, ORGANISATION, BUSINESS, POLITICIAN, AND GOVERNMENT MUST BE TRANSFERRED TO MONETARY EXCHANGE.  ONE NEGATIVE SCORE SHOULD BE SEEN AS OWNING MONEY TO SOCIETY OR VICTIMS THAT CAUSED HARM TO BY NEGATIVE CREDIT SCORE RECEIVER.

I passed the exam, but needless to say, I never even tried to grasp why that one complex formula gives me a ""generalized inverse"". And I was not fond of that.So I started wondering why does this stuff work, how are these things connected and how in the world could mathematicians come up with this generalized inverse? Then I found the linear algebra class on KA and every time I was on a train travel, I watched a video, then reflected on it, and did not stop before I deeply and intuitively understood what was going on.So, eventually the KA course ended, and it did not cover the concept of generalized inverses. But with all the genuine intuition I built up on linear algebra, I sat down and I was actually able to deduce the whole formula for the generalized inverse from scratch by myself! I was now one of those mystical mathematicians who could invent formulas that do fantastic stuff! And that was the very moment when I really valued what mastery learning is about. And I decided that was the only kind of learning I would do from now on. That was four years ago, and now I am a scientist and see a beauty behind all those formulas and concepts and how they interplay. So if you are ever in a situation where you could either learn for a test and are tempted to learn in and out a computing scheme, do not do it. Rather, try to see what's behind it, don't stop asking ""why"" until you really understood it. It's a tough road and you'll need a strong will to walk on it. But in the end, you'll have a really rewarding feeling of understanding. And you'll be proud of yourself as you are able to say that you now have the ability to deduce new knowledge and be an actual scientist in this area.",Talks at Google,en,0.9827762842178344

If we want to sustain our health, we have to do something about it! This will start by knowing what supplies our body needs. Start by eating a balanced diet, quit vices, exercise regularly and take an NMN supplement. Mine is a 500mg per day, NMN by Vitruvin. I just knew all of this lifespan information through Dr. Sinclair's book. It says there's no point increasing lifespan without. The goal should be to live longer while staying young and healthy. Sinclair believes that in the foreseeable future, it's possible for humans to live beyond 120 or even 150, without the frailty, diseases and disability we now associate with old age.

Trevor took it to mean merely not wanting to let go of excess wealth, and implied this was natural, that anyone in the audience would do the same thing.  Not only did he miss the point that the amount of wealth the ultra-rich possess is SO excessive no average person could even imagine it; he also failed to consider the other half of what hoarding is, the compulsion to keep obtaining MORE of something, no matter how much excess is already accumulated, just because it's out there to be gotten and they cannot stand the idea of not getting it.  So not only will some people refuse to give up any empty margarine containers from a house full of them; they will climb into a public dumpster to get another one, and it's the same thing with neurotic greed.  ANYTHING for the slightest increase in profits, ANYTHING not to let go of the slightest bit of profits.  Children going hungry, people dying of treatable illnesses, people turning to depraved or even violent acts out of desperation, people committing suicide suddenly or slowly......these are all things that the ultra-rich can accept, in fact, like a mountain of margarine containers, obscene wealth can obscure what's underneath.  The person doesn't have to look at it; they can take a private jet over it, and any time it does demand attention, it can be treated like rats and roaches.  Just build more prisons and warehouse all humanity that dares to get uppity.  Oh and be sure the prisons are profitable too.",Talks at Google,en,0.9711250066757202

I don't have the time or the patience. I have better things to do. Believe what you want to, but I can tell you firsthand as a gay man, I did NOT choose to be this way. I have always been attracted to men and that is how it will always be. Granted I am no longer sexually active, but I am still very much attracted to men. I love women as friends, and that's as far as it will go with the females. I get along with women very well, but there is no attraction or chemistry with them. As matter of fact, I am a big fan of Dolly Parton and I also listen to many other female artists, more so than male singers. I also believe in God, but I do not believe the bible is God's Word, because it was written hundreds or thousands of years ago by various people and it's very contradictive and is not accurate as far as basic history is concerned. With all the bad things that go on in the world, y'all are too damn concerned about something you can't do a damn thing about and do nothing where you could be making a big difference.

Things are not always that black and white. And that is the problem here: I live in a country that has the world record in tax pressure measured as a percentage of GDP. Look at the 7 bullets i presented in my comment above. I honestly think it is extreme!!!!!!  Considering that we have a world record in tax pressure: Wouldn´t it be fair to demand that we also have the BEST schools, the BEST hospitals etc? The fact is however that our health system currently ranks as number 25 or 26 on a global scale when it comes to the quality level. That also means that our health system is on the same level as in countries I would NEVER have thought I had to use as a comparison for my own country. In addition 15-17% of the young people here who leave elementary school - meaning having finished 9th or 10th grade - are socalled ""functional dyslexics"". That basically means that even our school system is very mediocre. I remind you once more: NOBODY pays as many taxes as we do in my country!!! You cannot just conclude that the higher the taxes the higher the level of welfare. Things unfortunately don´t work that way.In addition it has been proven a thousand times in my country that when the government has to run things like postal services, train-, bus and other public transportation, then it always ends up being MUCH more expensive and inefficient and with a lower quality level as when this is handled by private companies. We have a fairly low level of inequality here in my country. Adjusted for purchase power we have the highest welfare money in the world. Doesn´t that all sound really really great and like paradise? Well....it´s not always that great. There have been 2 or 3 documentaries in the TV here recently, where the documentary concluded that there are a substantial number of people here who de facto will earn the same on welfare money as they will earn in low-salary jobs. In the one documentary we followed 10 unemployed people who were given the possibility to start in job training. 3 or 4 of them didn´t even show up for the preliminary meeting. 5 of them said ""fair and square"" - ""Sorry....I will have the same available amount every month on welfare, and more time with my kids, I can´t take the job"". ONE person got a job. He kept it for ONE month. Then he was fired because he never showed up on time and called in sick even he wasn´t etc. etc. How on GODS earth is it fair to the young single mother with 2 kids who wake up at 4.30 every morning and drives 50 kilometers to work and 50 kilometers back in the evening - tired as fuck - when I then tell her that she is actually quite stupid, because she would earn approximately the same amount (or only a bit less) being unemployed. In addition she would even have more time for her kids. How is that in ANY way good for a society?I am not a racist, but in addition there is a VERY large group of immigrant women over 40 of age - we are talking probably 85-90% of them - who have NEVER been on the labour market here and who will do ANYTHING in their power to avoid having to go to work. That has ALSO been uncovered by a documentary program here. But why do I have to pay a marginal tax rate of almost 60% so they can walk around lazy at home living on other peoples money? How is that fair to anyone?I do not mind paying taxes. But the level in my country has just gone to the extreme where it is no longer acceptabel. In addition the high taxes will inevitably also drastically affect the competitive power of the companies here. A substantial number of companies are already moving their activities to countries with lower taxes and lower salaries. Like I said - I don´t mind paying taxes - but I also do NOT see how it is fair that I give away 50% of my monthly salary - and I feel I get absolutely NOTHING in return. And some people are taking advantage of it. So the big problem is that money are NOT always well spent in a high-tax-country, and at one point you will simply have a welfare system and a public sector that has developed to become SO massive that it gets hard to control it. Furthermore: Right after the Financial crisis - in my country - a statistic showed that for a short period of time there were MORE people here living on money from the government than people working in the private sector. Don´t get me wrong. Old people here should get their retirement money. Students should be helped financially too. People can get unemployed against their will and should be helped too. We need to have a public sector with teachers, nurses and Police too. But it can honestly become a BIG democratic problem, if a majority of people in a country who live on government money in one way or the other suddenly have the absolute power and can then vote for higher welfare payments for themselves. That, in my opinion, is a big problem from a democratic perspective. However that was the situation here not many years ago.Long story short: Things are not always as black or white as you make them - and it is not always like sugar and honey is raining from above, just because you live in a country that is taxing the fuck out of some people. High taxes and an ENORMOUS public sector is not (always) something to prefer. And there simply HAS to be a path in the middle of the road where people on one hand don´t have to beg/steal/kill to survive, but where on the other hand people also don´t feel they are being taken advantage of or taxed like crazy. I have been EXTREMELY tired of my current job too - that just makes me even more angry about the fact that some people are not contributing to the society even though they very well could contribute if they really wanted to!PS: When I turn 70 or 75 in 25-30 years from now, there probably no longer will be something called ""public retirement payments"" from the government, because due to the demographic development it will simply not be financially feasible for the State anymore.  When I am 70 or 75, I will have been paying taxes continuously since I had my first job at 14, - and in the intermediate years I will have been paying a FUCKLOAD of taxes and hundred times more than I will ever receive back, even if I should get the need for hospital treatmeant when I get older. Whereas other people will have been having a nice life on the worlds´ highest welfare payments, even though they could very well have contributed to the society if they really wanted to. How is there ANY justice in that?",Talks at Google,en,0.9431705474853516

I agree mostly with his idea of internal motivation, but I try to highlight two aspects of life that may hinder you from finding an internal purpose. Firstly, your life may be so tough that you simply don't have the energy to do the thinking and critical reflection necessary to identify such an inner purpose. Maybe you also have a poor education, and is not capable of formulating your feelings so exactly.The second thing is; the purpose that is given to you socially, may take the place of an internal purpose; for instance, say you are told that it is your mission to spread the good news of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. You may feel very internally motivated do do so, but these ideas are substituting what would be your purpose, were you in a different situation. Further, deviating from this  purpose will land you in trouble with your family. Yep, but for many of those in these kinds of situations, an strong personally made inner purpose would maybe have helped them, if they could get there.",Talks at Google,en,0.9914939403533936

At 10:46 Mr. Goleman specifies that "" ... managing ourselves turns out to be based on how aware we are of ourselves."". Is it always the case for it to be that way? As far as I know, according to the Big Five model, being aware of ourselves relates to the trait Conscientiousness and self-consciousness is a trait facet of Neuroticism. There is no correlation between Neuroticism and Conscientiousness, meaning they are independent of one another. So while listening, I was still thinking ""There are so many people overly conscious of what they feel and still not able to manage their emotions."". So maybe the cognitive ability to inhibit impulses is more important in this case? ( Sorry for this long comment. I am simply very curios about this topic :)) )",Talks at Google,en,0.9674546718597412

I think part of the problem people have with Malcolm Gladwell is that they are taking his ideas and trying to make into hard and fast rules. That will apply to all  peopleall the time. Thats not the point of his writing. He himself says he likes to explain things and he likes to tell stories, he is not Academian and he's not a scientist. His job is to make you think about things in a different way not necessarily give you answers.

They can’t dump all at once because it’s 55billion xrp escrowed into 55 accounts each containing a billion xrp. Each month, one of those escrow accounts open and all of their customers can use that xrp for the month. Whatever is taken, Ripple buys back in xrp to bring it back to a billion at the end of the month. Then that escrow has its 1 billion again and closes (then the next account opens and so on). This way you provide a massive liquidity pool for banks to use to act as one massive nostro vostro account. Therefore xrp has to be valued much higher if banks are going to use it. Also by having 1 billion tokens accessible a month, and the rest is still escrowed it ensures xrp’s price remains stable. It’s bloody genius. They wouldn’t dump because a. the economy would literally collapse. b. It’s their core business structure and what makes them so appealing to banks.As for xlm (which I also speculate will be valued highly someday) will be interoperable with xrp. The way it’s designed though makes it seem like it is more for the retail level. If banks move all their money through xrp, and then commercial/retail use xdc/xlm it makes the most sense to me.",Talks at Google,en,0.9487454295158386

I'm guessing you put Antarctica in there too because you think it's melting because CO2 even though it's actually melting in some spots, growing in others and has nothing to do with CO2. Here's some facts...1. Antarctica used to not have any ice and was nice like Cali. Just some little known info. Antarctica is not melting away as the media has been telling us for decades. The media reported for years in the eighties that by 2000 it would be gone and continents would be under water and there would be mass flooding and the so-called scientist are the idiots that fed them the that bogus information. They lied to media and even doctored their models and presented lies. The whole thing is disgraceful. Even worse they made the same predictions about 2010 and 2020. I encourage you to do some research but make sure they're reliable sources.    Believe it or not the globe and the climate have been changing for millions of years. Weather has too. I promise CO2 doesn't control the weather. All the events likes earthquakes, volcanos, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, fires, droughts, floods etc. have been  both better and worse for 100's of years. They were also better and worse whether CO2 was 1000 ppm  or 8000 ppm. All the same events still took place and the level of CO2 didn't control the events. It didn't make or melt ice and actually Antarctica has less ice in some places and more ice in others. There's a massive amount of lies, misinformation and propaganda out there. These days people can't (or at least shouldn't) believe the media or even some so-called professors. Information and facts have been replaced by ideology, feelings and opinion. The media is pure trash. These days they don't report the news they tell people what to think... and they do. Most people don't even know how to check facts. Hell most people seem allergic to facts and the truth.  2. Anyways... we're currently at the lowest 10% of CO2 on planet earth and it's the greenery that's suffering. It's why people buy CO2 to pump into their greenhouses and talking to your plants help them grow. 3. Clouds, water vapor, the sun and solar activity control the temperature not CO2.   4. CO2's effect on temperature is actually logarithmic effect. For example if it takes 250 parts per million to 500 ppm to get 1 degree of warming then it would take an additional 1000 ppm to get another degree of warming and then 2000 ppm, 4000ppm, 8000ppm and so on.  5. You've been lied to by the garbage media about 97% of all scientist believing in ""climate change"" formally know as ""global warming"" but the f-ing globe stopped warming and made their models look like the joke that they were. Anyways, I'll tell you where and how the lie started and if you have a fair mind, your own brain and interested in the truth you'll do your research and stop being lied to (but don't use google b/c they suppress information - the fascist pigs believe in keeping the world stupid).  Anyways it came from the abstract of the Cook article that reviewed the 11,000 abstracts 66.4% of the abstracts expressed NO position on anthropogenic global warming32.6% endorsed anthropogenic global warming. The abstract about the abstracts says... ""Among abstracts expressing a position on human caused global warming 97.1%  endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing the warming"". *- SOMEHOW THIS BECAME  97% OF ALL SCIENTIST -* 0.7% rejected it and 0.3% were uncertain. So the 97%  is 97% of the 32.6 or 97% of the less than 1/3 of the scientist that participated took a position dumb enough to think humans are causing the imagined warming that wasn't happening and it's been corrupted by $$$ and greedy bastards from that point on. It's so corrupt that they have abandoned the most important parts of the scientific method like careful observation and rigorous skepticism about what is observed.",Talks at Google,en,0.9875661134719848

To Mike, in the every end, (Thank you for asking the question Nicole!)   it was 20 year old you, and you said that you wished to start business way faster like 3 year eariler, does that mean your 17 years old would be able to write that sort of code already? may I know if I want to start platform buinsess like these, and I want to write code as your 17 years old, how may I gain the skill to that level? (I graduated from buisness major and I'm not afriad to learn coding but the point is I want to learn the right tool that it's exactly useful for build software or platform like that, could you direct me the way or give some suggestion?)Thank you very muchPuchit Hongsawat26/12/2022",Talks at Google,en,0.9921628832817078

Great. WHY EINSTEIN'S EQUATIONS PREDICT THAT SPACE IS EXPANDING OR CONTRACTING IN AND WITH TIME:Ultimately and truly, TIME is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL to the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. ACCORDINGLY, the known mathematical unification of Einstein's equations AND Maxwell's equations (given the addition of A FOURTH SPATIAL DIMENSION) is proven and explained. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. (Notice the term c4 from Einstein's equations.) It is CLEARLY proven. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. This is the ultimate unification of physics/physical experience. It ALL makes perfect sense. I have truly unified physics.Consider THE MAN who IS standing on what is the Earth/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE. (Notice that THE DOME of a person's eye is ALSO VISIBLE.) OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. The INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND DESCRIPTION) is improved in the truly superior mind. Indeed, the ability of thought to describe OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. It is ALL CLEARLY proven. In fact, I have also clarified, clearly identified, and corrected the limited notion of curved ""SPACE"". MY UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS SURPASSES ALL OTHERS. E=mc2 IS F=ma. A galaxy is basically FLAT. Think !!! GREAT. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE as well. It ALL makes perfect sense. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The Sun AND the Earth are F=ma AND E=mc2, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!! LOOK at what is the BLUE SKY. The EARTH is ALSO blue. NOW, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Beautiful !!!Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This explains F=ma AND E=mc2. ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of what is THE MOON MATCHES it's revolution. It is fully, CLEARLY, and consistently proven. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

It is important to see that if an algorithm does understands you perfectly' it does not become better than you in any way, rather it becomes a reflection of you and your identity(who is simply the reflection of other identities cellular/chemical).  Ultimately all technology is an appendage of the biological(Grand) algorithm.  Really the coming technology(even the internet), at least in my opinion, is a direct evolution of the Mind of Man and from an ontological standpoint there is no break whatsoever in the chain of natural evolutions which has brought us this far into Mystery furthering our quest of becoming more Beautiful and more Complex Beings.Really enjoyed the lecture.",Talks at Google,en,0.9336596727371216

It is totally feasible that you can do this without a person knowing it's going on because we do this all the time with animals by conditioning them to act a certain with certain stimuli. Pavlov's dog experiment comes to my mind, you ring the bell and the dog starts salivating even if the food isn't coming.",Talks at Google,en,0.9856107234954834

I think we actually call it ""failure to thrive"" when they are hospitalized simply due to this sort of thing, but it's very vague and can be related to more acute and treatable conditions.  A lot of times they're just getting close to the point of natural death (they're like 92 + years old) and not coping, but I can't imagine actually if I looked after patients who were all there due to ""aging"".   It would seem a bit pointless, what they could have benefited from was proactive homeopathic/naturopathic medicine rather than later being admitted for ""aging"".  Unless paid for privately, we would significantly lack resources to ever hope to ""treat"" these patients admitted.  The answer for many at this point in their health is symptomatic treatment and long term care.  Preventing aging as a medical disease would require significant upstream thinking and implementation of healthy lifestyles which lets face it - most people are far far from living.  But for those who do want to prevent aging or aging poorly, it's nice to know there are many preventative measures we can take.",Talks at Google,en,0.9470351338386536

Another way of staying togather is one to another inthe same side lets say all places in NORTH  are the same, all positive charge but still all are jointed one to another so JOINTIG  the north side, same efect happens to south jointing the south, there are other factor as efect of gravity done by the CMB that to me is cold and discharged light thats makes its way back and finally there is the electromagnetism that each side produces part is ignited at the white sphere or center to keep the system stable in balance in the disc or splash of the 2 energies that produces the disk that is the division of UP and DOWN.SINCE we dont know much of gravity to me is good to present some numbers done with math of NASAS METRIC SHEET and envolving some others well known numbers and some not to well known like:1.618(golden number number) PI, 7.23, 108, 10080, 300000km/s light speed etc.some numbers involved are in many cases by countin as groups all togaher as say77.86M/S2 that is the amount of gravity of the 8 planets in the disc all added or as the next:17126.594 that is all the mass of the 118 places in the periodic table  all added.1157.5217 is the mass of the NOT METALS.644.7581 Is the mass of the METALOIDS, 15323.898 METALS MASSAll of this numbers for hundred of time apear from all over whene combining data that to me deserve been taken in count.All the numbers could go up or down as needed so the small and the big is no problem they fit well.3629.0307 is the mass from #1 element to the 56, and 3629.0307/1391016km(suns diameter) = 383.30235/3.1416 = 122.00864 and 122 is a neutral number to me. some times you find equetion like: the above instead of 3.1416/383.30235 = 122.00864 the intention of doing it is for not to cut the serie number, make it easier and shorter.2341.288/1391016 = 594.19735/3141600(remember that all numbers can go up and down, in this case is the PI 1000000 times)= 5287.1322/3.1416 = 1682.9425/6.472(1.618 times 4) = 260.03432 that is a common denominator of a galactic day of ours practicly.1682.9425/300000 = 178.2592/89.28 = 1.9966308.89.28 comes from the gravity of the 8 planets in the disk and  the sun(274) all added =351.86/31416(the PI 10000 times)= 89.285511(this number comes from other sourses that is exact 89.28).594.19735/300000 = 504.88276/6.472 = 78.010315.3415.0973/1391016 = 407.31372/300000 = 736.533/3141600 = 4265.3893/3.1416 = 1357.7124/3.1416 = 432.17226(close to common denominator of the sun in Hz.)407.31372/400697(are the diameters of the 8 planets in the disk all added)= 983.75522/1.618 = 608.00693.3683.1782/1712659.4(the 118 places of the periodic table all added times 100) = 464.99498.4058/300000 = 73.928043/16180 = 218.8614671.618 0 = 135.26666/3.1416  = 43.05661443 is neutral in the flower of life, is one after 42, 43 is not found naturaly in earth it spreads all over aftaer is made.44 is the step to the nex orbit some how to the 61 place of the periodic table 61 nither is found in earth and as made is gone to so is another neutral element that spreads its energy as soon is made.there is a way that we can find the  61 places in the 42 petals in the flower of life  if you count the ASTERISKS and seeng each petal as an eye you count the left and right sides of the eye and you get 19 places so you have 61 places in the 42 petals.The next flower that you may find is the smallest ones counting only the sides of the eyes and not the ASTERISKS so you have 19 places.at the 19 degrees north or south is were there is the most energy in the planets.the 19, 42 and 61 places that each make a flower that goes numeracly to the inside in cressent form and each make it the same bigening in the inside and grows out numeracly to the out, so we have 3 pairs of flowers in where in each pair one goes in and one goes to the out, each pair could be acomodated as one pair for H, one pair to HE and the other to Li as our sun goes in in 11 years and goes out in onother 11 earth years were 22 years is a sun compleate cicle based in block spots in the sun.The 85 is found if you double 42 = 85 plas the element = 43 as a place you make the 85 and actually wehen you count the mass to the 85 place its the doble to the 42 back so if we see it as space and gravity in our solar system the rocky ones are half of the out side planets the gaseous ones some how it does sence to me seeing this way. the 19 has something to do with the 87 nither found naturaly in hearth.19/300000 = 15789.473 is a common denominator of the 3 wave lenghth that the H has that are nanometers small the wave lenghth of the H. not sure in this one but for sure is a common number.15789.473/77.86 = 202.79312/3.1416 = 64.550903 -

Her point that ""technology does not equal neutrality"" is very important and gets lost in a few areas where AI is introduced as a kind of savior-technology.The quite useless ""would black women make you happier?""-direction of many posts here completly ignores that very important core of her analysis and the implication for a lot of services. Very often the knowledge base used is not really representative of the goal. That results in people being inconvinienced, emotionally hurt, silenced or physically injured because e.g. the healthcare industry does not check their kb.

He did make points about that the interface can introduce complexity for the entire codebase. Meanwhile, if you have a 100 lines of code function in your class it´s more localized complexity. You inherently always come back to the famous ""well it depends"" with making statements about this. When you have an interface with a single ""RunTheThing"" function and hundreds of lines of code behind it you just wrote an extraordinarily deep class that is also extraordinarily horrible. But say for example you´ve got a CLI application going. It happens to have 10 arguments. All with default values and some documentation. I would not be offended by the resulting code if you put all that in a single ""ParseArguments"" function. Sure it will probably be like 5 lines give or take some per CLI argument, then spaces, creating the parser or whatever and creating the result object. You easiely end up with a 70 lines code function. Still, it´s not complex code and if you have a block for every variable and use good variable names, its still I would say just as easy to read as if you created a a function for every argument. So, I would argue wether or not you want to pull that one apart becomes personal preference at that size in this case. You can always pull it apart later. And that is a case where it is at the same time very easy to pull the method apart if you decided to. There are cases where it´s really challenging to pull methods apart below 50 lines and cases where no questions asked the method does too much and should be pulled apart. I think obsessively long methods are an indication of bad code. So in that sence I believe it to be a good rule of thumb to set yourself some limit. But I would say also that it´s one of those rules you can break. Just be careful when you do and re-evaluate wether or not this method is getting out of hand or not.",Talks at Google,en,0.9859588742256165

However as far as passion, Liz Gilbert in ""Big Magic"" goes over writing a huge list of everything you're interested in and just pursuing it. The end result not being money. Your dayjob can still exist while you cross these things off the list. And if you get to the point where you're lucky enough to live off it, then great. If not, you were fulfilled. That's what living is. That's like saying ""I'm a scientist, I can't learn how to cook tasty food for myself because it won't build up my career"". Not trying to slate your argument or anything.That's why people are told to follow their passion, because life is short and if I'm selling hot dogs and I wanna learn the piano, well, I'm gonna take some classes when I sell that final Bratwurst of the day. In any case, I'm super interested to hear this perspective further in the book.

""When we excluded data for participants known to have changed diet group at least once during follow-up, leaving data for 4270 deaths before age 90, there was no significant difference in risk between diet groups for all causes of death combined, as follows: low meat eaters, HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.02); fish eaters, HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.02); and vegetarians and vegans, HR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) compared with regular meat eaters; P-heterogeneity = 0.13 "" That is, in your first linked study, the vegetarians and vegans had the best mortality outcomes once they cleaned up the data. Now imagine people eating truly WHOLE FOOD plant-based diets. Well, we know that you can drop risk of premature death from CVD to essentially zero on a VLF WFPB diet with lots of greens. Another study on SUPER health conscious Buddhist monks showed rates of diabetes dropping from very low in the very low meat consumption group to ZERO in the totally plant-based group. And so on. Some people MAY be better off eating a tiny amount of fish, eggs, or meat per month, but the best overall health outcomes are found at the end of the spectrum characterized by low consumption of animal foods. In fact, a ""health-conscious omnivores"" MEANS among other things someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat.Take care.",Talks at Google,en,0.976357638835907

I'm human. I care about myself suffering. Long story short I got off opiates 4 yrs ago... got into bodybuilding. On drugs I barely ate at all. 1 meal a day for many yrs I never knew what ""hunger"" meant as I couldn't feel hunger while using. So I get clean, start running/working out... and start eating TONS of chicken and fish. My muscles start growing. But after only 2 yrs of doing this (I'm 36) I start getting pain so bad in every part of my body. My neck, my hips, my back... I replaced all my furniture multiple times... still getting pain. Buying special pillows and pads, still in pain. I keep telling myself ""maybe I broke the pain center of my brain by doing too many opiates"". But the longer I went on, the more I realized ""I wasn't in pain like this my first year OFF opiates... so WHY am I in pain now?"" I remember being depressed & anxious AF... but I wasn't having pain like this.So 7 days ago I decide to cut ALL the meat out of my diet. Start doing tons of beans & broccoli (I can't eat rice). And if anyone saw how I'm sitting on my sofa right now... legs twisted like a pretzel, hunching forward with terrible posture... I would be crying right now if I tried to sit this way just 7 days ago.I'm now starting to flip the paradigm on my entire life. BEFORE I started using opiates I was a gym rat eating tons of meat and was in great shape ... looked so ""healthy"" but always felt tired, anxious, depressed, sleep problems, etc. I'm actually starting to think that a high meat diet was causing me to be depressed back then... which is why I started using. Maybe I was too young to feel the physical inflammation back then and it experienced it more as a mood disorder. But I'm now starting to wonder  how many people have depression or anxiety problems just from eating too much meat on top of all the hormones and pesticides that come with it.Not sure what else to say but thank you for this video. I really can't remember the last time I got so excited about something I really feel like I've walked through some health matrix... and really need to test this lifestyle for like a year minimum while documenting my results.

The people need to be heard and involved for a government to be legitimate—as the saying goes, if you’re not at the table you’re on the menu. The framers knew a balance was needed between the people and their government, because they’d lived under autocracy in which people were seen as tools for government to use and murder as it arbitrarily saw fit. Also, that government by angels has never happened. Absolute power corrupts, and leaders without input from the people they govern are at best in the dark for making decisions and at work at, as in fascism, see people as things to be exploited, manipulated into anger and fear, and disposed of as desired. Fascism is built on dividing an us against them. It’s for the fair-skinned, but the Nazis were thugs who terrorized and stole valuables. How has it ever been, and how is its ideology even in theory, fair? Fascism — not all dictatorships but fascism — started with Mussolini in the 20s. Opposition to it is not some recent campaign against an ancient peaceful idea—it’s literally been tried and proven terrible for its entire existence. Communism has been a disaster but at least it’s supposed to work to improve all human lives, purely in theory; fascism doesn’t even claim to aspire to that. Historic examples you don’t agree with are not automatically propaganda. Propaganda is media of misstatements meant to prop up a regime or actions people wouldn’t accept otherwise — art that dehumanizes others to make their murder palatable, for example. Statements that fascists tend to murder people or follow certain patterns to deceive people isn’t propaganda; it’s lived experience.",Talks at Google,en,0.9468711614608764

They are the builders of these gigantic megalithic structures.  The earliest of these giants stood at 36 feet and got shorter and shorter over many millennia, down to 15 feet height.  These megalithic stone structures are found on every continent on Earth.  Evidence shows that the Giants lived on all parts of the globe and had advanced stone-building societies.  These are all facts that archeologists, anthropologists and scientists are only now beginning to investigate and to come to terms with as the TRUE HUMAN EVOLUTION HISTORY ON EARTH.  This ancient history has been staring us in the face all along, screaming out for us to unveil the true origins of our past and learn the identity of our super-human ancestors.  But Evolutionary scientists (proponents of the Darwinian theory), Smithsonian Institution and religious (Catholic) community have been hard at work covering up the evidence of our ancient past.  Finally, the doors have been flung open to the truth where we can enter inside and say ""hello"" to our ancient ancestors and marvel at their grand magnificence and beauty!",Talks at Google,en,0.94920414686203

Anyway, Ra speaks about how the human bodies natural life span is supposed to be 900 years. Ra attributes the decline to matters of the spiritual mostly (in that spiritual energies control physical matter). I got the impression from Ra that when people DID live 900 years - it was wasted on them and spiritual progress was slow to non-existent. People had no incentive to be better people or love more. Shorter life spans helped speed up spiritual and moral progress. Perhaps we’ve come full-circle and are now ready for a reset to 900years... but do we love our fellow humans enough to live with them that long?",Talks at Google,en,0.948541522026062

Most no-pedigree dogs are more intelligent than the pedigree ones.   Your secret was - LOVE.  You loved your doggy, talked to him, were proud of him.  He paid back by trying hard to please you.  It took understanding more words than the commands other dogs get.  Any dog would do it for you receiving the extent of the love you were giving your ""smart"" doggy.  When you love your buddy - you talk to him/her.  They listen, try hard to understand & please us.  My city-boy dutchund on his 1st visit to a village was taught to stay away from paultry (he instinctly went to hunt them). On his  3rd stay in that village he was suddenly asked to bring the chicks back from the bushes.  Human effort was useless.  Brain new task - he was never herding any animals in the past. It only took him glancing back into my eyes following the request ""bring the chicks to me"" and a hand stretched in necessary direction.  In no time ALL chicks were back in the yard.  Another example of the dog's genius: 3-4week old  stray kittens appeared in our house.  Once i came home and did not find them.  I spent 10-15 fearful minutes looking for them as they were very, very young.  My duchund followed me around the house on this search.  I finally looked at him and asked:  please, find the kitties.  New words - no kitties in our house before, never said these strange words to him. Took their litter box and showed him close to his nose.  And...bang! - he turned away and took a shortcut to behind a stove where the kitties warmed up and fell asleep.  I am not saying they understand every word we are saying (so many meaningless and confusing words we use) but...their IQ goes beyond the commands we ""train"" them to execute.

However, for many individuals engaging in similar activity, a feeling of pleasure is also reported, but only when their covert musculature is inactive (i.e., a state or rest). Because relaxation activates opioid systems, and tension inhibits them, it is postulated that dopaminergic activity further stimulates opioid activity, but only during resting states.This hypothesis can be easily tested and is described in greater detail below. If correct, it will demonstrate for the first time that elevated and sustained arousal and pleasure, or ‘eudaemonia’ or ‘happiness’ can be induced easily through simple modifications of abstract perceptual properties of behavior that anyone can easily do throughout the day.    THE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT OF POSITIVE AFFECTAFFECT AND MOTIVATIONOpioid and dopamine systems represent bundles of neurons or ‘nuclei’ in the mid brain that are respectively responsible for the affective states of pleasure and attentive arousal, and sub-serve the neural processes that govern motivation.  OPIOID AND DOPAMINE SYSTEMS ARE ACTIVATED BY DIFFERENT STIMULI EITHER VIRTUAL (COGNITIVE) OR REALEating and drinking, having sex, and relaxing or resting all activate opioid systems, whereas the anticipation or experience of positive act-outcome discrepancy (or positive surprises or meaning) activate dopamine systems. OPIOID AND DOPAMINE SYSTEMS CAN CO-ACTIVATE EACH OTHERTaking our pleasures increases our attentive arousal, and increasing our attentive arousal accentuates our pleasure. If these systems are concurrently activated both are accentuated or affectively ‘bootstrapped’, as both pleasure and attentive arousal will be higher due to their synergistic effects.  OPIOID AND DOPAMINE SYSTEMS CAN BE CO-ACTIVATED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT OF SPECIFIC ACT-OUTCOME EXPECTANCIES OR RESPONSE CONTINGENCIESAs characterized by the well documented ‘flow response’ (pp.82-86), consistently applied contingencies that elicit pleasurable resting states and consistent attentive arousal result in self-reports of heightened pleasure and energy.  This emotional experience can be easily replicated by simultaneously applied contingencies that elicit rest (mindfulness protocols) and meaning (imminent productive behavior and its uniform positive implications). To achieve complete rest and accentuate positive affect, these contingencies must be applied for periods of at least a half hour or more. Just as one sets meditative sessions to last for a set time period and frequency to be effective, so mindfulness and meaning sessions must be similarly arranged, with cumulative sessions if possible charted to provide proper feedback of efficacy. Finally, the intensity of positive affect will scale to the importance or salience of moment to moment meaningful behavior, with the more meaningful the task the higher the pleasurable affect.  IMPLICATIONSAffect is as much an aspect of how information is arranged as what information is, or the abstract rather than normative properties of behavior.  It follows that as a positively affective state, happiness is not just a product of what we think, but how we think, and derives not only from our pleasures but also from our incentives. Positive incentives can accentuate those very pleasures that we wish to maximize, and conversely, associated pleasure will increase the ‘appetitive value’ or ‘liking’ of incentives (or in other words, increase the value of productive work), and all sustained by simple choices within our grasp, as is ultimately happiness itself.  I offer a more detailed explanation in pp. 47-52, and pp 82-86 of my open source book on the neuroscience of resting states, ‘The Book of Rest’, linked below.https://www.scribd.com/doc/284056765/The-Book-of-Rest-The-Odd-Psychology-of-Doing-Nothing This above book is based on the research of the distinguished neuroscientist Kent Berridge of the University of Michigan, a preeminent researcher and authority on dopamine, addiction, and motivation, who was kind to vet the work for accuracy and endorse the finished manuscript.Berridge’s Sitehttps://sites.lsa.umich.edu/berridge-lab/ also:Meditation and Restfrom the International Journal of Stress Management, by this authorhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/121345732/Relaxation-and-Muscular-Tension-A-bio-behavioristic-explanation",Talks at Google,en,0.9598024487495422

The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.

Consistent with those findings, mice genetically predisposed toward pancreatic cancer developed more precancerous and cancerous growths when they consumed the NAD+ precursor NMN. Zhang says more research is needed to fully understand the role of NAD+ in cancer, but he adds that “we should be cautious and bear in mind the potential downside of NAD+ supplementation as a dietary approach for antiaging.”https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cancer-research-points-to-key-unknowns-about-popular-antiaging-supplements/A ‘Fountain Of Youth’ Pill?  Sure, If You’re A Mouse.Despite his enthusiasm, published scientific research has not yet demonstrated the molecule works in humans as it does in mice. Sinclair, however, has a considerable financial stake in his claims being proven correct, and has lent his scientific prowess to commercializing possible life extension products known as NAD+ boosters and Sirtuin activators. https://khn.org/news/a-fountain-of-youth-pill-sure-if-youre-a-mouse/",Talks at Google,en,0.962990701198578

There, by that alone, Krauss excused himself of all of that. You simply come up with a childish snot-nosed brat excuse to call it ""nothing"". But it gets worse, space, matter, time, and the laws of physics, called nothing, created more space, matter, and time. The laws of physics were broken to create more space, matter, and time. Keep in mind (for those that have a working mind), that this ""nothing"" was eternal, and just by chance about 13 billion years ago according to Krauss, then did its magic. The 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics were asleep then. Krauss' attempt to dispell the need of God, just confirms the need.""A vacuum, to us, is a space with no matter in it.

Not just that, it shows from the start who gave up their logic and who did not. From all we know, creation HAD to be a supernatural event. The first logical and honest step is to admit that. The second step is to seek who or what did the supernatural event and the proof for that. Fools jump to 'who created god', 'god of the gaps', 'science does not deal with supernatural' and whatever excuse they can use to prevent them from seeing the truth. All they can do is fart smoke screens to avoid the issue at hand.Those that deny it was a supernatural event, such a Krauss, Dawkins and a whole host of other fools, live in their fairytale of just making things up with nothing to back them. They say things so outrageous that they ask you to give up your common sense for science. Krauss and Dawkins go back and forth calling it ""literally nothing"" knowing it is something, and even their something can't produce what we have. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT3dfPOdAYUKrauss admits he does not give a damn what nothing means and he then says he wants to be honest with his readers. He is full of doublespeak. He is WRONG and all he has is pride to continue saying such stupid things. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=1""One unsolved mystery is why there is an excess of mater in our universe; this is the Matter/antimatter problem. Why is the universe only made of matter? Matter/antimatter particles annihilate each other to produce radiation. Radiation coverts to equal amounts of matter and anti matter. Krauss says that the CMB suggests the photon-to-proton ratio was a billion to one. He says that by ‘plausible quantum processes’ the universe started out with 1 part per billion more matter than antimatter. Most of the matter and antimatter combined to make photons. Later he admits we still don’t really know how this asymmetry between matter and antimatter began.""""The energy calculated for empty space assuming virtual particles is 10 to the 120 times greater than that observed. This is a long-standing unsolved problem.""""Krauss also says that this proves you can get something from nothing given the energetics of empty space and the law of gravity. So he says you can get a universe from nothing if you can start with empty space with non-zero energy and the laws of gravity and quantum mechanics. He admits empty space with non-zero energy is something!""Quotes from another review of Krauss' book here: http://creation.com/review-krauss-universe-from-nothingYou can read Hawking, Krauss, Dawkins, and others who praise their gravity but they just made it up and have no idea where it could have come from. And the list goes on. All they have comes down to nothing. From the start, fools gave up their logic and that does not bother them.

Like I wonder what the level of entanglement is at the heat death of the universe.     With the universe spread out so far, energy density infinitesimal, the conclusion should be low entanglement... yet, by then, the splitting of worlds has reached its finite limit, and every place in space is indistinguishable from every other,  so, in a way, it is all the same place, i.e. a singularity.... sort of,  but one where all vector field values are zero.   Oh...wait...  I see, this may be I'm the kind of crackpottery that we need to protect ourselves from! Still, I wonder, according to GR, the shape of space can induce motion through such space, cause a delta in inertia.    In a relatively ""flat"" area of space, not greatly curved by another large mass, motion can only be induced by applying a some external force,  (i.e. clumps of atoms moving at a high velocity, becoming so close to a clump of other atoms that their electric fields induce a change in motion in each other)  also altering inertia.   If GR says these are indistinguishable from each other, did we just curve space briefly by smacking a billiard ball into another?    So is all acceleration an emergent property of entanglement, too?I guess I'll have to buy the book.",Talks at Google,en,0.9625320434570312

Roger has however been outspoken against the brutal Zionism in Israel responsible for decades of appalling brutality, death, maiming, torture and persecution of Palestinians and theft of Palestinian land. It is a sad deceitful and unjust lie by Polly and David accusing Roger of being 'antisemitic' when in fact Roger has been doing nothing other than rightfully criticizing Zionism (not Judaism). The appalling murder, maiming, suffering of the Palestinians taking place in 2023/2024 proves the cruel wickedness of Zionism in Israel. Roger has been absolutely correct with his harsh criticism of Zionism. I do wonder, given Polly's and David's criticism of Roger (for his criticism of Israel), do Polly and David therefor support the 2023-2024 Israeli slaughter and maiming of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians men, women, children and babies in Palestine and mass destruction of their homeland and livelihoods? Have Polly and David been supporting the decades long of theft of Palestinian land and murder, maiming, imprisonment and torture of the Palestinians who've resisted their land, homes and livelihoods being stolen by Israel? Would you Polly and David accept all your material wealth, your various homes and properties, all your material assets and everything else you've been working so hard for in your lives to be stolen from you, as Israel has been doing for decades to the Palestinians? You would resist the brutal eviction from your own properties wouldn't you? I bet you would. You sadly have both shown yourselves to be hypocrites for labeling Roger antisemitic when Roger has done nothing other than bravely stick his neck out (and copping a lot of flack for it) arguing on behalf of the Palestinians, for Israel to stop the brutal theft of Palestinian land and stop the brutal persecution of the Palestinian civilians who resist the theft of their land and livelihoods.

As an end-user I want my music to sound as intended by the Artist and the collaborative team that created it.Bottom line for me is I don't want my music compromised by corrupting Lossy codecs or transcoding issues and I also don't want to suffer that mental fatigue or exhaustion described earlier. I want listening to be a pleasure rather than a chore.I am trialling a Bluesound “Powernode 2” with Tidal and Spotify while my Pioneer SX-750 is in the workshop. I was planning to ditch my small LP collection, rip and store all my CDs as FLAC files in a Bluesound Vault 2, but now I'm reconsidering because maybe prolonged exposure to Lossless CD, ripped FLAC files and Lossy 320mbps MP3s are mentally fatiguing too.Lossy codecs appear to corrupt the Artist/Listener relationship if the end-user (the ""Listener"") does not end up hearing the music as intended due to fatigue or other issues.Many thanks.",Talks at Google,en,0.9844024181365968

I paid attention to her campaigned and learned that CARE of HILARY, my entire pregnancy and delivery of my fifth child (at age 42 I got rid of pregnancy from my insurance,oops!) Sadie  was born with a heart condition. The best cardiologist in the Midwest was in Wisconsin and treated her bulked billed on Badgercare!! It was a great shock because the Republicans so cynically allowed Trump to campaign on fraud, and gutter nationalist politics and even insult our military families!! McCain had deserved his mistreatment to some degree because of his silence when previous campaigns maligned John Kerry! The Alt Right saw Hilary coming and the anti-intellectualism and misogyny fed in as well. I just hope the stark contrast between the choices we now face will allow our values to VIC e into sharper focus and be less messy!!",Talks at Google,en,0.9706913828849792

The thing with terrorists is that they mask their extremism and political hunger with religion. ISIS mask their terrorism with Islam, Crusaders masked their invasions to the East with Christianity, Zionists masked their invasion to Palestine with Judaism. None of those three scriptures have any problem. The problem was in the extremism of the recipients, and the so-called religious figures who misinformed those ISIS, Crusaders, Zionists, that their heaven and pleasing God was in killing or invading lands.

Inefficiency would mean that somebody could have profited from the volatility, but even going back in time with the knowledge we have now, we wouldn't be able to: Once you realize that a market has too little supply, you couldn't simply run to the next market, buy fish, run back and sell it, or someone would have been smart enough to do that. You couldn't have bought the fish on days were supply was overabundant and stored it for a day were supply was low to sell it at a premium because it would've gone bad.

He seems to know what he’s talking about and better yet, has the studies and research to back it up! I do wish he would have touched more on the bases of how the meat and dairy industries are in bed with the cancer ‘research’ industries yet are advocating/recommending for the very things to eat that cause cancers. It sickens me to see so many research foundations that are asking for donations to fund better/more research and have yet to (say they) found a cure while they line their own pockets and make people sick. Idk how many yogurt containers I have see in the store that I wanted to chuck down the isle because they slapped the pink ribbon and the Susan G Koman Foundation logo all over it! It’s sad when people look at you like you’re the devil when you say you refuse to support these organizations. I know his intentions weren’t to eat out the companies that have a hand in the cancer industry, but I think it would help had he mentioned more on this topic. Research is good when you can get things from one source like here and know it’s backed up, but if you put a bug in someone’s ear enough to get them thinking more about one thing (like the link to dairy and cancer and the companies that endorse them) it might make them do more research into the other companies who produce the products they that they buy from as well. It’s so hard to make people understand these things when they’re brainwashed into thinking they’re good for us. My husband still thinks dairy is great because his grandmother told him so and it makes for stronger healthy bones and thinks that’s why he’s so big and strong now because she made sure he drank a lot of milk when he was younger. He can’t see that this advice is coming from someone who’s whole entire generation is dying mostly from cancer and heart disease more than any other age group out there. I don’t fault her because she didn’t know any better at the time, but at the same time it’s sad the advice we blindly follow based upon what we are given and it makes it hard to retrain our minds to change our thinking and behavior based upon that because people don’t want to admit they’re wrong or what they believed so strongly about was wrong even if it could literally help save your own life in doing so. My own grandmother and grandfather both did die of cancer so it’s hard to see why people won’t change if given new information to change your ways of living. It makes me so upset to see that the cancer industry makes so much money and won’t allow us to see the cures outside of ‘modern medicine’ and only want to push chemo which makes so much money that drs don’t want to find a cure because sick customers make for repeat business and the money is what keeps them going. The sick-care industry would crumble if no one was sick to keep them in business. Just imagine if the majority of patients who needed help were mostly only due to injuries. You saw this list here of the top reasons why people die and all but one of them were due to accidents! There’s so much.....TOO MUCH money to be made in this system to shut the cancer and disease side of it down do you better life style habits and just trying to tell people what they NEED to hear! Imagine if we had cancer warning labels on things like dairy or meats just like we do in cigarettes. It would put those companies out of business so fast which wouldn’t be a bad thing. Many people would lose their jobs, but what’s a job that could be lost compared to a life? I’m sure that would mean that more jobs for farming would open up and eventually equal it’s out, but you can always find a new job, you can’t just find a new life after you die from making bad choices. And if we don’t know they’re bad, how can we make good judgments based upon that for a better life? It’s sad that so many people don’t know any better and are relying on their drs advice to make them healthy again and all they want to do is push meds and treatments that don’t even cure anyone. I honestly wish that all drs were required to read these studies and learn some common sense knowledge about eating better. I would say that would be a huge simple solution to our issues in this industry, however, something tells me that because sick people make for more money in this industry, even if research was required, it wouldn’t matter the sad matter of the fact is that it doesn’t make the drs richer. This is a business! No amount of better research and half a brain is going to do anyone any good if the drs are just greedy, not al, some just don’t know any better, but some do but just don’t care. It just goes to show you that just because you went to school for medicine for several years and have that shiny certificate to prove it, it still doesn’t necessarily make you the smartest or wisest person in the room.",Talks at Google,en,0.958190619945526

I started school when I was almost seven years old. I knew the alphabet up to the letter D, could count to 8, and could not tie my own shoe laces.  I still had trouble hearing the difference between s and z, and identifying the stressed syllable, even by the end of my first year, was still totally beyond my developmental level. Yet by the end of the year I was one of the two best readers in my class (running neck and neck with a clever little girl), and had no learning deficits of any kind.  Other students have been known to start school as late as age 8 and quickly make up for lost time.  Learning deficits are not the result of any lack of early education, but result from biological deficits. Of course, Swedes are mostly environmental determinists who refuse to grapple with the genetic science, so they continue importing vast numbers of lower IQ immigrants to their country. Those intellectual deficits will never be closed.  ""You can ignore reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.""--Ayn Rand",Talks at Google,en,0.9908173084259032

A musician it's supposed to convey his conscious intentions through the medium of the instrument, not mindlessly meander. I think there is something to what this man is saying but I fear he doesn't even know himself what he's experiencing when he's playing. Music doesn't come from muscle memory or from 'the fingers', it comes from the soul, which is rooted in the mind; the mind being the heart of a man. The process being taught here sounds suspiciously like transcendental meditation, which is complete BS. You cannot learn or communicate anything worthwhile by disconnecting from your mind.This is almost a carbon copy of those pathetic 'how to speak in tongues' lessons by fake Christians of the hyper charismatic movement peddling their mindless drivel, that teaches one to just blurt out random syllables which results in gobbledegook.Or like the 'painter' who throws a bucket of paint at a canvas and then relies entirely on his audience to find some subjective meaning in it as they scratch their chins. There's no merit in that on behalf of the painter. Music is a language (an actual language) designed to communicate emotions and feelings. A musician is someone who communicates his thoughts and ideas and message via harmony and melody. The art is in ability to accurately and  intentionally communicate those things rather than just throw out random sounds in various ways and then claim that the soul is somehow channelling.The mere fact that a musician must practice and practice is a clearly contradicts and refutes the basic claims of this talk. I am not claiming that this man is a charlatan or a fraud, merely that he is misinterpreting what is happening when he improvises. It is true that fear of failure will affect performance, but suggesting that one must disconnect oneself from one's mind is preposterous. The mind is where both the intention and the knowledge of music theory reside.",Talks at Google,en,0.979454517364502

I.e., just believe the dogma he spouts.   His claim that physicists have decided to ""calculate"" as opposed to explore physics is BS.  Physicists for the last multiple decades have tried to ""understand"" quantum physics and its relationship to relativity theory (see, e.g., Einstein's last decades of his life).  In fact , physicists convinced world governments to spend TEN BILLION DOLLARS on the world's biggest microscope (the LHC) in order to do exactly that.  And in what was supposed to be its most important observation -- super-symmetry-- it failed.  Brilliant physicists (i.e., not a Sean Carroll) like Nima Arkani-Hamed,  Lee Smolin, Julian Barbour and many others, who reject the simplistic but satisfying dogma of those like Carroll should have convinced us mere mortals that the ""explanations"" offered by our newest Sean-Carroll-like priests are as fundamentally wrong as those offered by our priests-of-old.",Talks at Google,en,0.9024983048439026

Eventually we will all be known as human instead of insert country of origin here. I do agree that religion especially Islam will keep this type of idea from being realized. There are many issues with the way people around the world view each other and the ideas the spew forth from those other peoples.

The Holy Scripture says.......And that's that, end of discussion.....Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.Romans 1:24‭-‬30‭, ‬32",Talks at Google,en,0.910918951034546

What have people been able to do with their time that these technologies have supposedly helped them save? Playing video games or taking hours getting to or from work.  Sad to hear that some still think having many products in the store without other having jobs just to get your technologies adopted is worrying. Google needs a community of ordinary people from all over the world to being user insight and perspectives in to the design of products and services. None of these men who stood up to speak considered issues of the environment and the perspective of people different from them. They are part of a system that is increasing inequality.

Never. I challenge you to point me to a single instance of it.What Dawkins does ridicule are those who make unsubstantiated assertions & outright false statements...he doesn't like liars & bull****ers. Me neither.Also, do not conflate confidence earned as a result of hard work & knowledge, with ""over-bloated self-image"". Dawkins hard line comes from the former, NOT the latter!!The world is full of people who are all too eager to assert things that do not have the slightest connection to reality & who seldom make any kind of evaluation of the nonsense they are positing...like someone who has never used a computer trying to tell Bill Gates how to conduct his software research. Such people deserve ridicule for their ill-considered words & anger for wasting peoples time bcz THEY were unwilling or too lazy to do the work.They simply must learn to think about what they say before making fools of themselves by boldly asserting unsubstantiated nonsense.btw  911 taught many people about the dangers of believing nonsense. It also taught the rest of us to be a lot less tolerant of those who adhere to any such faith based belief system.Time for god to show up HIMSELF...like they SAY he used to.

Thompson, another Vedic creationist. He believes that modern humans, i.e. Homo sapiens, have lived on the earth for billions of years with little or no alteration to their biological characteristics. He sometimes writes books on Hindu spirituality under the pseudonym of Drutakarma Dasa.One of the core notions in Cremo's Forbidden Archaeology is the assertion that a system of knowledge filtration exists within archaeology (and by inference, the greater scientific community). This ""explanation"" conveniently makes it possible for Cremo to reject the (literal and literally) mountains of evidence contradicting his pseudohistorical and pseudoscientific claptrap.CredentialismAccording to his own autobiography, Cremo has no scientific education (bet you never would have expected that).[1] His website though proudly lists his membership in several professional associations. Looking into the admission criteria of these organizations, it is clear that membership is not tied to expertise:  the History of Science Society admits everyone willing to pay the annual fees;[2] they have also produced a statement on evolution that contradicts Cremo's ideas[3] the Philosophy of Science Association has three types of members - ""full"", ""associate"" and ""student"".[4] Only full membership requires any professional credentials. The PSA also shares an online membership directory with the HSS, but as of November 2010, Cremo is not listed in it as a member of any of the two organizations.[5] the World Archeological Congress is open to everyone willing to pay the annual fees[6] the European Association of Archaeologists accepts both ""full"" and ""associate"" members.[7] Only professional archaeologists can be full members. Cremo's autobiography does not specify what kind of membership he has and there is no online members directory.Cremo is also a ""associate member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute specializing in history and philosophy of science.""[1] The BI is ""the scientific research branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness"", according to his own website.[8] 'Nuff said.",Talks at Google,en,0.9335697889328004

Given the prevalence of cheating, for instance, even monogamous sex is not safe sex.      So the mentality that the SF poly community fostered in me was one of caution in how I selected partners, a clear agreement with my wife first and other lovers second, and an attempt to create a safer sex conversation with anyone I intended to be involved with.      (For those who are stereotypic in their thinking, my wife also had lovers in SF, and she followed the same agreements as I did. When we had a mutual lover, he also did. Also, we're still together, though at our age in BC Canada, neither of us is actively involved with someone else. Poly was easier in SF.)      The overall point that I'm making is that there is no such thing as safe sex in the real world.

When I go about the streets near my home  that are shops that plays some kind of bad taste folk songs. I just can not hear them right. They kind of not reach my mind and what I hear is something so funny and different that I can not help bursting out laughing.I have an enormous difficulty in understanding what I hear, but my hearing tests shows that I can hear very high pitches, even dog's whistles. The problem is I can  not  construct or I do it with a lot of difficulty and very slowly.  I had a dream where two people came to me to explain the way I hear. One of them was a professor at the university I studied. His name is Jacob Zimbarg Sobrinho. The other person was Brazil's first lady at the time, Ruth Cardoso. Both were alive at the time. He is a mathematician. She was an anthropologist.  I would be kind of both had life given me the chance. I really got impressed by Led Zeppelin's song analysis.  Our unconscious see much more and in more dimensions than our eyes can see. And so with our ears.  However our unconscious mind is like a blind, deaf powerful giant in this world. It needs our conscious minds to carry that lamp to guide him.  The lamp is the world of Jesus Christ and our understanding  of it. I took this example from Carl Jung biography. He did not mention Jesus Christ, though, but he was a Christian and as a Christian the word of Jesus Christ was part of his conscious mind.I kind of like the work of Carl Jung a lot and I would like to read the presenter's books.",Talks at Google,en,0.9921269416809082

His entire point is that a nation IS it's people - all of them - the political right derides anyone that doesn't share their views as being ""anti-American"" or ""unAmerican"" and doesn't include them while supporting right-wing policies that put corporations and interest group's profits ahead of the people. That is the whole point of the title of his book that he explains - America has serious issues involving how it treats it's own people(especially on the right but the left has it's share too) but the far-right(less 'far' these days) doesn't think these things are problems if they don't personally affect them and instead suggest the problems are 'liberalism' that specifically seeks to ensure ALL of the nation is living to the same standards. To 'MAGA' then caring about the people that are the nation must be the focus but instead the far-right thinks the way to make the nation 'great' is to do less to care and to destroy the safety-nets we have in place for people who aren't as privileged as them. Yes those systems get abused but instead of talking about ways to fix it to reduce or eliminate the abuse the right prefers to attack 'libtards' and dismiss the entire issue and demand that huge parts of the nation be abandoned to rot in the name of their personal beliefs.Oh fuck, who am I kidding there is almost no chance you read all of that let alone understand the issues. TLDR; Society is only as a strong as it's weakest link - the left and intelligent centrists want to strengthen all the links to build a greater, stronger nation while the right wants to purposefully break the chain and get rid of the links that are weak while strengthening the already strongest links in the hopes that they can solve the problems simply by changing what the nation actually IS - redefining it doesn't make it great it just lets you ignore it's lack of greatness.",Talks at Google,en,0.9286835193634032

Take my following note as a genunine complement - he reminded me the tone of my mother who got us all to do homework by scaring us without scolding or shouting. She would just not smile but keep saying - 'oh, those who dont study have to find a job like begging' (not her exact words, just giving you an idea..) and whenever we suspected what she is saying she would sidestep it to bring on this and that to distract us into working hard. One day humanity may thank Nick for doing something very similar - instead of getting distracted by the (low-right-now) probability of a catastrophe he wants to us to minimize the severity if (and when) it happensHe is like the engineer who had the wisdom to tame combustion by containing it into a chamber, before putting it onto a cart with smooth shiny wheels.BTW, his Simulation Argument (search youtube) scared me and held my thought captive for a week or two!

Ken Fisher would have disagreed to the advocated approach that one asks for limited downside and unlimited upside in a trading or investing decision. Those 1% rule is a popular trading rule, but not for investing. And yes, for three times the questions are fired citing the 50% stock price decline and he said he can buy it back.It again comes down to your conviction on the stock market timing. I like his earning approach, and I think he eventually failed on the part between indexing and stock picking.If 200-day is the sole TA indicator you have, you will soon find yourself frustrated going in and out in a sideway market. Moving average only works in a bull, or bear market. Unfortunately, we only know the trend in hindsight. MA is in no way a reliable predictor for future performance. Many charts shown here is heavily biased to make a point.Lastly, decide for yourself whether you are a hands-on or hands-off person.Hands-off = low-cost broad based indexingHands-on = stock picking (w/ trading mentality like stop losses, bet sizing, TA, & fundamentals like earning).Value investing in particular needs a long time to play out, hence mixing value investing with trading mentality is an oxymoron.

No coincidences last name Wolf.   Well well,  Clear and concise you break down capitalism.  You couldn't paint a better picture?  I understand it.  I Not unlike Marx have had a good 50 years to observe it.  I am pleased with this aspect of the presentation.   I am disappointed however in the obvious salivation as it drips off your chin.  No pause for reflection. No discussion, No questions.  Finishing the last sentence,   Professor Wolf Is opening this exquisitely wrapped gift; without taking a breath      he shifts into high gear and presents the Marxists ""alternative"" as if it was his own idea.  Jumping from a galloping horse to a speeding locomotive.  We have Democracy in our community; therefore logically we must incorporate it into the work place.  With all due respect  sir, that was what, the 19th century.  Oh it just sounds so logical, I get it.  I put salt on my food. It's only logical  therefore, I should pour it in your wounds.  It's good for you, give those wounds a little zing.  I am so disappointed. For a man as studied as you claim to be,  You could not come up with something more professional?  wow.  I am really disappointed.  I could easily designe a better system.   I would keep the competition.  I would maintain a class structure,  where higher levels are achieved through merit, strength, initiative, charity, community.  I would leave open the doors of opportunity to become wealthy within reason. Start doing George Sores and you will get a knock on the door.  The  Marx workplace environment is not something I would do well in.  I have a very low tolerance for ignorance.  There is always that guy that has to ask a bunch of stupid questions at the end of the meeting.   One thing about capitalism in the US everyone is free to be one.  I see illegal aliens come in here and they are driving nice trucks with their company logo on the side. Black lives matter could take a lesson from that.  I would choose to have the opportunity to make my fortune or not over some democratic co op.   Too much to expect from people.  People can handle  being giving a task, knowing what to do and doing it.  The guy can push a broom, but not really good in the marketing dept.  You  started out brilliant. I thought I was going to learn something.What a let down.  I'm glad I watched however, I can recognize a Marxist anywhere.  That's too bad, I really had hope for you.  I really thought you had a better alternative.  I can't believe you don't.  You simply regurgitate a two century old concept that sounds brilliant because it has ""Democracy in the work place ""  Well may I suggest ""mail in ballots.""That was great,  going from eloquent historian to ruthless used car salesman in an instant.

Firstly, he mentioned falling asleep on a chair in the Burhanpur train station.  This is different from his memoir, which states that it was a wooden bench.  That being said, the fact remains that he was sleeping somewhere one does not normally sleep, and it must not have been particularly comfortable.  A similar situation is found in the book “Living with a SEAL” by Jesse Itzler, where a man sleeps on a wooden chair as part of his training.  This highlights class differences that exist in the world today, where two people sleep uncomfortably for vastly different reasons.          Later in the interview, Saroo described himself as having a good visual memory.  This explains why he was never able to identify Burhanpur on the map his mother Sue gave him.  It was indeed a visual representation of India, but did not provide landmarks like the water tower that formed Saroo’s knowledge of the place.  Most discussion of ‘memory’ surrounding Saroo’s story is on the subject of panic making a person jumble memories, but also important are the different ways in which people access them.  For Saroo it was through visual, satellite imagery, but another person might have had more success by listening to audio recordings of the places they were lost in.  Both those methods are made possible through the Internet, which was also a subject in Saroo’s talk.           When asked how he used technology to find his hometown, Saroo said Google Earth was preferable to “...go[ing] to the library...” or “going to India, and paying thousands and thousands of dollars...” (Subject of ‘Lion,’ 12:50-13:25).   He also admitted that this was only possible because he had the privilege of accessing the Internet.  Internet access is quickly becoming a global issue, with the United Nations even making it a human right (rights on the internet, 2016).  This is something the interviewer alluded to in the introduction.  He said “Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible” (Subject of ‘Lion,’ 3:40-3:43).   If that mission succeeds, there may be more happy endings like Saroo’s in the future.",Talks at Google,en,0.9689680337905884

The title caught my eye in an airport bookstore. I had never heard of him before. The ""crypto"" part of the title is what got my attention because of what my job was in the Army. Then, reading the short bio on the back cover I was surprised to see that Neal was born at Fort Meade as was I. To add to that little coincidence, as a part of that bio there was a photo of him as a child reading a book on cryptology. About the same age my dad had given me a book on the same subject. I loved Cryptonomicon. The blending of English and American history with the events in WWII was fascinating.

But then coming across Phil Collins who was not only an incredible drummer, but a good enough singer and performer to replace Gabriel when his left, and also before hand come up with the likes of Steve Hackett to replace Antony Phillips when he did, is just too much luck. How did so many mega talented people come together in the same band? Which also begs the question how did all of these egos manage to put up with each other as long as they did? The obvious answer seems to me that they are all particular shy, and fundamentally insecure people, including most surprisingly even Phil Collins, and Tony Banks.Another strange thing is that only Steve Hackett seems particularly satisfied with almost all of what the band produced. Most of the rest seemed more interested in getting a hit single, and appearing on Top of The Pops. Where they all still trying to impress their own mothers, or fathers? Grammar schools boys are rather strange people, after all. People who come from reasonably stable and comfortable family backgrounds, have great difficulty coming to terms with their own success. They always want more, even if they are not particularly interested in the money, which few of them are as they never really struggled for want of same as youths. They also have a habit of looking a gift horse in the mouth as others within their own early acquaintance or families seemed to have achieved perfectly nice, happy and more contented lives for themselves, without having to prostitute themselves to the Music industry to make a living, put on a false front to fans or the public as a whole, get involved with accountants, promoters, or other aspects of a business, or possibly humiliate themselves before a live audience. You simply can't be in as deep into something as insidiously evil as the Music industry, without often getting the feeling you have in some ways sold your soul to the devil. You see it all in its most horrid, over time. You may console yourself by repeatedly claiming to yourself and others, that it is all about the Music, which it may very well be, but they can be forgiven for often thinking that maybe it just was not worth it, and that they may have been better off, just becoming an accountant, doctor or an insurance broker, as at least their marriages may have lasted, their minds less deranged, and their kids been happier.OK, they all wear it far better than people like Roger Waters, but you can often see the English Post Christian middle class cracks appearing in all of them.",Talks at Google,en,0.9746224880218506

Then since bit state computers (digital machines) don't have the same physical architecture as the brain, they won't be conscious. They lack the right kinds of combinations of EM fields in order to achieve consciousness. This is obviously a possibility.In which case no AI built using a conventional computer would ever be conscious. That would be due to physics.

However coming from a computing background and comparing genes to binary it is possible that genes have evolved 'checksum' logic, which is the mathematical model used to encode data for reconstruction in the event of loss like data on disks arranged in a RAID array or carried along in each IP packet where a ,relatively, small amount of storage space is used to store a computation that can be used to reconstruct any piece of lost data on the disk or reconstruct the destination address of an IP packet in the event of corruption. He also compares cells to having a genetic backup implying cells keep a full duplicate of the gene. However checksums are far more efficient and would be encoded as part of the gene itself. So I wonder if many of the sequences for which a direct function cannot be directly identified or is thought to be remnants of viruses or functions we no longer require are actually part of the genes check-sum which is used during the repair process and if by interfering or deleting them we would cause the gene to be incorrectly repaired.",Talks at Google,en,0.9817128777503968

The only bad fat is manmade transfats, saturated fat is probably the best and healthiest. Stop living in the past. But of course I know veganism needs lies and distortions and omissions in order to spread. It truly is a fear based religion, and most vegans are victims of vegan lies, distortions and omissions. The most important health rule is to not combine larger amounts of carbs with larger amounts of fat in the same meals. Not with any type of fat. Long term carbs + fats = obesity and heart disease. But just as you don't blame the carbs for disease, please also don't blame the fat. People either need to eat LCHF or HCLF. High fat probably being the better choice seeing that cancer cells need sugar. Low carb non vegans are no doubt less susceptible to cancer than any high carb vegan. 30-50 g of carbs a day vs. 300+(?) g of carbs a day........... As for cholesterol, read about it on low carb websites. I eat 150-200 g of fat a day, mostly from animal sources. Have done so for years. I had my cholesterol checked a few months ago, total cholesterol 177 mg/dl, LDL 103, HDL 58, trigylcerides 129. Not too bad.

""Simply evil is the word we use to define something that is intentionally wrong or harmful, each person has a subjective view of this however as populations (communities, states, etc) we can make a generalised objective definition of that which the majority deems immoral or wrong.""They are just subjective ilusions of human construct, without God man is just beset with delusions of moral grandeur.""Yes evil and good are human constructs, descriptors of how general society find behaviours and actions of sentient life. As without providing any proof of God or any deity whatsoever, your assertion stands as a completely pointless statement. It is a non sequitur, your premise does not in any way support your conclusion.  If it did however, we can deduce by just taking the moral standards of modern society, and then comparing them with the moral decrees laid down in the old testament, your statement would show there is no God. If however our moral standards were the same as those, laid out in the doctrines of yours, or any religion; we could deduce this religion was morally well ahead of it's time and perhaps this could even be used as reasoning for belief in a deity.  However this is not the case.""Morality becomes an individual prefrence or a colective choice, just as people prefer chocolate over vanilla, as Michael Ruse said: ""The man who says it is morally acceptable to rape little children is just as mistaken as the man who says 2 + 2 = 5""Excellent point. So if your doctrine has a morally good god commending rape then it is as wrong as saying 2+2=5,  right? So verses like Isaiah 13:16 and Zechariah 14:2 as just two examples would lead you under your same logic to conclude the doctrine is immoral.""Where does the atheist base right and wrong?""Same place as the religious, common consensus. Is killing your first born child good or evil, moral or immoral? What about if you burn them on a pyre? Stone them at the front gates of the city for disobedience?If your doctrine states that God commands something that is obviously immoral or wrong, whether subjectively in your opinion, or objectively in the general opinion of humanity; do you ignore all the rest of humanity and carry on following the ridiculous, archaic and thoroughly immoral and evil doctrine? ""And if there is no base, the argument from evil against God is useless it is like cutting of the branch you are sitting on.""No, your logic here is just plain faulty, when someone uses the argument from evil they use it to show how an omnibenevolent being cannot possibly exist. Someone using this argument to show that this supposed property of the deity cannot be reconciled with reality, does in no way remove their grounding or understanding of right or wrong, they no more cut away that reality. What they show is the deity as claimed by the bible cannot logically exist within our reality.",Talks at Google,en,0.9496392607688904

So if you take your annual expenses and divide that by 4%, you get your FI number or the amount you need to save to never worry about  running out of money. Once you reach that target, you no longer HAVE to work, but get to  CHOOSE to work.",Talks at Google,en,0.9627442359924316

Diesel exhaust is classified as carcinogenic and the particulate fraction has in itself been linked to several adverse health effects including cancer.MethodIn this review, we summarize the available scientific literature covering human health effects of exposure to airport emissions, both in occupational settings and for residents living close to airports. We also report the findings from the limited scientific mechanistic studies of jet engine emissions in animal and cell models.ResultsJet engine emissions contain large amounts of nano-sized particles, which are particularly prone to reach the lower airways upon inhalation. Size of particles and emission levels depend on type of aircraft, engine conditions, and fuel type, as well as on operation modes. Exposure to jet engine emissions is reported to be associated with biomarkers of exposure as well as biomarkers of effect among airport personnel, especially in ground-support functions. Proximity to running jet engines or to the airport as such for residential areas is associated with increased exposure and with increased risk of disease, increased hospital admissions and self-reported lung symptoms",Talks at Google,en,0.9821356534957886

The sad thing is ""Das Kapital"" isn't required reading for every high school student.  Students should critically think about the American economy.  An introduction to Marx from these washed up old Marxists is a disgrace to make.  Their emotional appeals are just too pathetic.  Just what America needs with a psychopath  in the White House.     What you won't hear from the Marxist's is: 1. HOW to run an employee owned co op,  2. Why you should ignore the evidence wealthy countries have capitalist economies and every socialist economies all fails?  3. Free markets feed the the citizens of capitalist countries, socialist economies can't.  4. Can coworkers civilly discuss politics in the work place?  No?  How are coworkers going to cooperate to run a country.?  5.  For every 1 successful employee owned co op there are 1000 successful entrepreneurs. 6. Not every capitalist works for a corporation, small business is the backbone of a capitalist economy.  Does capitalistism deliver all American politicians promise?  The evidence says that capitalism it does NOT, but it's the best humans have tried.  Politicians in both capitalist and socialist governments lie to the public.  Think politicians care more than the board of directors?  I hope everyone does critically think the American economy because America likely won't have this same system forever; at some point Americans are going to have to confront the realities of capitalism, hopefully not while Trump is in office.

And this then begs the question: why is the ""primary"" relationship the primary one? What kind of purpose does it serve? What does that wedding band on your ring finger serve 45:03 , if not as a ""traditional"" symbol? And if it serves an emotional bonding purpose, then what do you make of the ""other"" relationships? Are they for ""banging"" purposes only? And if this is OK, do you then deny that emotions/hormonal bonding is inextricably linked to the sexual act? And if you are having a good time and loving everyone you're sleeping with but you're someone's favorite and it's getting in the way, do you ""break up"" with them? Or is ""amorous"" just a gloss on the label and polyamorous really means ""multiple partners who you don't care for more than you care for yourself but who you are nonetheless honest to""? The reason none of this sounds OK to a person who is not partaking in a ""polyamorous"" relationship is because if that person puts themselves in your shoes (or barefeet) they will find themselves in a very perplexing situation if they actually think things through. Yes, you can expect a lot of demand for therapists.

The rest went to buddies of politicians.I'm happy to analyze any policy you want because it's always bad.The best policies are police dealing with violent criminals.But that's only a small portion of what they do.Most of what they do is extortion of hard working people.Money that's used to poison society with wellfare.Which allows women to be irresponsible and get into relationship with bad men.As a result they end up raising boys alone resulting in far more crime.I'd say 90% of criminals would not be without government poisoning society.And 90% of what government attacks people for wouldn't be considered criminal, like building houses:https://reason.com/2020/02/05/undercover-cops-hired-118-handymen-then-arrested-them-all-for-not-having-licenses/Here's the government attacking people for trying to do good because they didn't have permission for bureaucrats.It's terrorism",Talks at Google,en,0.920416533946991

Nowhere in this presentation does he present data to show this is bad for the environment. I'm not saying it isn't bad, but I don't see how any policy maker can do anything with this without having more information and research into how to interpret it. One of the criticisms of Google is that we can get a lot of information but nothing to help us in interpreting it.

I have PT twice per week, thigh to toe compression stockings and a mechanical pump to help move the fluid from my leg.  I'm furious and heartbroken, it's depressing to know this is my new lifestyle.  My surgeon who I appreciate for removing my tumors, basically handed me off to oncology for tx.  Thankfully she listened to me and got me into PT.  But surgeons need to inform their patients of the risks.  I was totally blindsided, and as a working mom to 4 kids, this is a huge obstacle to enjoying my time with them.

Now, having said that, I do not agree with you comment to the Chinese gentleman, when you said that China will suffer the same issues due to it allowing the Capitalists to come over and succeed in China. The reasons that I do not agree with your analysis are that in the Capitalist system it is the economic system, meaning the rich, who own the economy, will decide the political agenda, the rues and laws on how things will be, regarding the wealth distribution and how the lives of the people will be shaped as a result of that. The rich are the ones who own the economy and bankroll the politicians that are elected, and in turn the politicians will cater to the needs of the rich and rich only. In the Communist system, it is the government which decides how the economy will be and in the Communist system, the people are taken care of first and foremost, taken care that they will be educated, provided with health care and all of the necessities of what people need to live a comfortable worry free life, provided with the needed services at the lowest cost and in some cases for free, before anything else, unlike the Capitalist system, where everything costs and costs a lot, as you are well aware of. So if a Capitalist, for example, moves his cell phone making factory or whatever factory he has, to China to cut down our costs, you can be guaranteed that the Chinese person producing these cell phone or whatever else they produce, will be able to buy these products at the cost that he or she is producing these products, the Capitalist can take these cell phones and sell them in the U.S. or Germany or wherever he wants to sell these phones at, at whatever price he wants to sell them at, but in China he will sell them at the cost that they are produced, because the Chinese government will make sure that their own people will be able to buy these products that they produce and not be taken advantage of by these Capitalists. The reason that the Capitalists move their factories to China is not only because the low cost of labour but also because the working force is much more organized, educated and larger than anywhere else in the world. So your claim that China will suffer the same as the U.S. or any other capitalist country suffers because of the Capitalist system, is not true, because the Chinese communist government will first and foremost take care of the needs of its own people. As far as the billionaires in China, you can be sure that they pay more taxes than the average Chinese person, as it should be, and you can be sure that no Chinese person suffers because of the wealth of these billionaires, since there is no exploitation of the working force as we see in the western capitalist countries.I would like to hear what your response to my post is and if you can, please email me at: moshe.roseshter@gmail.com.",Talks at Google,en,0.951188027858734

He said that biphasic sleeping is practised within some older tribal communities and involves around 7 hours of sleep during the night, followed by a nap later on in the afternoon. He speaks of a hardwired, evolutionary dip productivity in humans between 2-4pm. This happens, he says, regardless of whether a large lunch was consumed, regardless of the person's diet, wellbeing and regardless of whether or not optimal sleep was achieved that night. He recommends that naps, while good if kept on the shorter side, should not be taken if you are someone who has issues achieving good quality, uninterrupted sleep during the night. If you sleep just fine during the night, then naps should be of no detrimentWith regards to audio, he did some videos for Penguin Books UK here on YT. One of the questions he answered was whether white noise/ocean sounds etc can assist with sleep. He said while there are no concrete findings on this yet, one of his theories was that non invasive tones played during sleep (sounds that can be played but that won't wake you) could sync up with the brain wave fluctuations we experience in different stages of our sleep. If this was true, it could mean that a deeper deep sleep could be reached through the use of rhythmic or repetitive tones or sounds. The video explains it better than I can, haha",Talks at Google,en,0.9880861043930054

These are four countries of which there is never reported news in Belgium. Of course, the same goes for Finland, Romania or other Balkan countries with the exception of something important like election results - but even when Podemos won the elections it was only briefly mentioned as a headflash. The news didn't attempt to explain the motivaiton and ethics behind Podemos, nor why they became so popular in Spain. What was important for the news to show was how poor this country had become, then years of silence, and now of course our Flamingant reporters are idolizing Puigdemont and his idiotic ""hermitage"" in our capitol. Not only are national politics in Belgium a fraud, so are European politics.

Before the term ""Empath"" was coined, I always referred to it as being a ""Social Vampire"", being that I felt myself taking emotions and energy from others, and wondered if it was true that the most contagious thing is insanity. . . And if I could be infected more easily by it due to this condition which I find within myself. . .  Apparently, it's true if you don't monitor yourself carefully.  At least, us Empaths have the inborn ability to recognize if something is going south, and head it off.  Another thing to be aware of, which in today's time little is mentioned, but a very real issue, is hypnosis.  If one realizes there are those who's job it is to hypnotize others, such as advertising agencys, being an Empath one can realize the ""Bullshit"" lines once one knows they exist. . .  It feels like a lie, . . Which Every Empath I know of does indeed recognize and realize, what, when, and where they are being lied to or about.  If everyone was an Empath, the world would be a much more friendly place. . .  Jus' saying.  One observance to be attentive of:  Empathy has no relation to time or distance, and it can be a ""recorded thing"" in which effects all.  Hence Advertising works.

Price controls would be the downfall of worker cooperatives.  Prices, which are the ultimate measure of value achieved by the most democratic process of each consumer's vote in purchase or not, must be free to fluctuate according to the perceived need of each individual.  Therefore the value of currency used to measure price must be stable in the long run which calls for sound money backed by something of solid quantity.Price, based on and measured by a sound currency, would offer producers a tool in the decision of what to produce while also offering consumers a tool in the decision of what to consume.",Talks at Google,en,0.9536619782447816

Tommy's ascent of the Dawn Wall from the sheer enormity of the climb to the winding path he took to do it when he was so so close to his goal he couldn't do it without his partner.

If you're going to comment on a video even vaguely about linguistics, you probably know something about the etymology of the terms you're using. Given that SJW was a term explicitly in order to engage in well poisoning and belittlement of anything that the original users perceived to be too PC (including, but not limited to racism, sexism, and homophobia-- and relevant to the topic of the video and your comment, linguistic purism), one would expect a linguistically inclined person to avoid it.",Talks at Google,en,0.9673783779144288

I am  afraid of the dark so as soon as I walk into a dark room I switch on the light. What the hell is this child talking about is probably what's going through your head right now, so imma clear it up. The dark room is confronting the fact that we feel empty or even that we may have a slight prooblem or addiction [atleast thats how i interpret it] and me switching on the light out of fear is instant gratification. so as soon as we look into the fact that we have this emptiness, or a problem we switch on the lights run right back to our comfort zone to try and fix this problem, help fill this emptiness. And then we feel good for a second, like when i switch the lights on I feel safe for like five minutes before getting paranoid about other things like open windows etc. But imagine if i just stood in that room and accepted that if anythings gonna happen its gonna happen. Then instead of using the light to aid with my eyesight and make everything seem bright and safe and warm, i start seeing things myself exactly how they are and i stop thinking of my fear and just move on and do what i gots to do. SO imagine the great things that could happen if we accept the fact that we feel empty or the fact that we are facing problems, and instead of trying to fix it the way we usually do we try something new and it actually works and we start moving past our problems or like Mr.MIchels says "" we fill the emptiness on the inside"". I know i sound crazy and that this makes very little sense but I'm going to put it out here anyways.",Talks at Google,en,0.9940524697303772

I have been around since Ike was president andhave had this birth defect since, well? birth. I have tried many things.Actually just about everything from chiropractors, to accupuncture to meditation.Even tried some different drugs. Had an operation and the only thingthat worked was a combination of an opioids and exercise. Yes, you have to mentally inspire yourself to get up and move around to stretch andsuch. But some person who does not suffer from what I have trying to tellme it is all in my head is a charlatan. I have about 12 books on healing back pain.Thus the reason I do certain stretches and lift weights in a certain way.But it is just  a part of my solution. I am also on blood thinning medicationsand that negates me taking NSAID type pain meds. I suffer no sideeffects from opium. In fact it keeps me alert as well as quells the pain.I can take it as needed and stop at will. Some days I just do not feelthat bad and don't bother taking any pain meds. Yes, I hurt, but not bad enoughto bother with pills. I do not suffer from an addictive personality disorder soeven hard narcotics are a non issue for me. But, not everyone is like that.I am lucky. the combination of stretching, exercise and opioids has allowedme to live a pretty much normal life. So,  at this point with about 60 years ofpersonal research under my belt, I am not buying into what this guy in the video has to offerand what most of what I have read is trying to sell me on. We are all different.What works for me may well be deadly for another. But, for millions of us suffering from chronic pain, opioids have been a God send.",Talks at Google,en,0.9905245900154114

Flaw within the argument is ""look at this example, therefore every policies of government doing stuff is bad"" is overgeneralization.2.How does it allow women to ""marry the state""? or Which policy does it?and from the black communities from what I have heard it is other factors in play, like over policing from another perspective which I heard, or maybe simply trauma and racism caused these crimes to happen in the first place? I remember hearing some policy in NYC where police were allowed to stop any car for search or something like that, 90 percent of the time police stopped only black people despite being minority in that city. And just so you know I am not from USA either, so which country are you from? I am from Serbia.3.I am not advocating for government doing stuff LOL, besides that is absolute trash policy, I could see why it could end up in disaster, I am pro worker cooperative's, which means instead of privately owned organizations we have more worker cooperatives in case you don't know much about it, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative4. ""obtained through pillaging and looting"" how is taxing obtaining through that? What??? Most of EU countries have Free healthcare, nordic country has free education, as well high taxes. I am not proposing for everything to be free, I am proposing for higher standards of living :).Nah your the one delusional, your only accepting one part of history not the whole, and cherry picking over and over again, therefore cycle of delusion continues, because you misguide yourself with stupid narrative.

At 10:25 he says nuclear and hydro are the best ways to combat climate change.  The problem is that nuclear power costs 3 to 5 times other clean energy sources and also it can't economically adjust its output to follow load, which  is a requirement if you want to use a single generation source to meet all your power needs. Wind and solar aren't perfect because their output is intermittent. However, they're really really cheap compared to nuclear.  In the short term, by far the cheapest approach is to pair wind and solar with hydro and natural gas and maybe some batteries as their cost comes down.  In the long term, most energy experts expect solar and wind to get paired with hydrogen powered generation, with the hydrogen fuel created and stored when there's an excess of wind and solar power.",Talks at Google,en,0.9894578456878662

He states that a computer program is just a bunch of rules that someone else (someone with a true understanding of the Chinese language) has implemented. This may be true in the case of the Deep Blue chess computer or AI - programs back in the eighties. But nowadays a modern neural network finds the rules itself.Anyway, I agree with his statement ""syntax is not equal to semantics"" but unlike him I think that neural networks are a promising model to study the emergence of such a thing as semantics.

I was positive about the deadly Virus called Herpes simplex virus  and I lost hope completely because I was rejected even by my close friends. I searched online to know and inquire about cure for Herpes & ALS and I saw testimony on how Dr Osas cure so many people from the  Herpes Virus Disease, HIV, Fibroid, Cancer, Hepatitis, etc so I decided to contact the great herbalist because I know that nature has the power to heal everything. I contacted him to know how he can help me and he told me never to worry that he will help me with the natural herbs from God! He sent me the herbal medicine through DHL, I used the medicine as he instructed me (Morning & Evening) and I was cured! it’s really like a dream but I’m so happy! That’s the reason I decided to also let many people know about this. you can also contact Dr Osas via: Email:Osad2383@gmail.com or WhatApps/Call +2349154653305...........................................",Talks at Google,en,0.9440959692001344

Like most academics, his studies are narrowly curated to fit a narrative. In 2008, the US economy crashed, yet we were nowhere near a collapse that would render people starving in the streets, although that is now happening in Venezuela's socialist country. Marxism deals with ""distribution"" which is a complete misnomer. Distribution doesn't happen, billions of local interactions are how societies interact socially and economically. This is why central planners failed so miserably because they were unable to react quickly to constant changes in supply and demand. He also doesn't seem to realize that the US is a capitalist society simply because it is capital rich due to its phenomenal geography. He probably wouldn't even know what I mean by my last sentence because he hasn't studied geography or geopolitics. Guys like him are a dime a dozen in the halls of academia. He doesn't like the capitalist economy because he doesn't like the 9-5 grind it entails, so like most people he hid in the tranquility of professorship.

Just love these guys. They all are genuinely humble and have such an amazing understanding of the impact of this movie. Rami is so laid back and he lets the others guys do most of the speaking and I think it’s really how Freddie’s personality was - he was an insane, superhuman performer but off stage he was quite shy and reserved. Joe and Gwylim embodied their characters perfectly as well. I love the backstories especially about their favorite song. I love how Rami asks the interviewer why he likes I Want to Break Free. He’s genuinely interested in what other people think about the music. Also his story about how Under Pressure came about - I’ve never heard that story before and the history is really incredible. Gwilym said it perfectly in describing the live music. I usually don’t like recordings from live shows and prefer the released tracks but Queen’s live shows were just beyond anything I’ve ever heard. I listen to those more than anything and am so thankful for all of the video footage out there.",Talks at Google,en,0.993898868560791

Why should a corporate structure own peoples data? Ultimately we people feed Google the data. Also questions if developments in personalised ads and the massive mass surveillance it has as a consequence should be opposed has to be asked. Also if those structures need to be destroyed if they go too far. One can just imagine what happens if someone gets access to all those structures simultaneously. People who work in Google maybe should all study Enlightenment values and not just blind engineering principles that ultimately follow the ideology of progress.,Talks at Google,en,0.9408718347549438

The Beatles were moulded in the two years in Hamburg when Best was with them. He was in the first session at Abbey Rd, then booted out when The Beatles were on contract to EMI. He may have had a legal case against them as the contract was with The Beatles, of which he was one.Pete's drumming was fine, Martin even said so. Pete played an off beat which was popular only in Liverpool, which was a part of the distinctive Mersey Sound.  The southern England people at Abbey Road could not identify with it and criticized Best's drumming.  At the time London was an appalling place for popular music - totally way back and in the dark. The London bands that thought they were ""in"" played Blues, as did the Stones. Liverpool bands were not heavily into Blues, having a great mix of American music with their own added.",Talks at Google,en,0.9486272931098938

No. It depends on your judgment as to whether you can sell this specific thing: my view as to whether I can sell anti-tank shells in Germany in 1943 is entirely divorced from my view of aggregate demand. The manufacturer never thinks of aggregate demand. It's a fiction created by economists who've never made nor sold anything except bad ideas. The (supposed) rationality problem caused by downturns, and the superior rationality of the economist that allows them to see why losers should never have their assets sold at auction through liquidation, are necessary beliefs for the economists. If they weren't constantly telling us how to get out of the problems which their profession creates they wouldn't have jobs. The only economic notion that's interesting when it comes to economists is rent-seeking behaviour: the kind they engage in. Why does Yanis never discuss the market clearing not just for commodities (or, more accurately, products) but also for the plant and machinery that makes them? Why is the solution to these cyclical downturns never the liquidation of these assets at bargain-basement prices, the destruction of all the investors in the banks, and a society moving forward with newly-capitalised banks and cheap products manufactured by those who have low costs because they bought their plant from the first ""mouse"" who was silly and was squashed?

England participated in colonialism after slavery was abolished. It was also not the first/only place to abolish or refuse to participate in slavery. Mexico fought a war to end the practice after the English expanded it in their territories. You are judged by your own actions.  Nobody accused you of owning slaves, but the entirety of the white race has benefited from the exploitation of those deemed non white. The only reason for such categories is the unequal distribution of resources and you have been socialized into participating.  ""Any notion..."" so you are the real victim here lol. Racism is not simply a notion of shame or guilt but a very real outcome for those who endure it. Suggesting that the world is just supposed to exist with people of darker skin colors at the bottom in such obvious metrics is to hint that white supremacy is a natural feature and that the past has nothing to do with the future.

In biology organisms are thought as systems. Systems are very different than algorithms. They are made by algorithms but when those algorithms work in unison or in teams they produce different results than if they simply worked alone. In other words new unexpected properties arise in systems that are not predicted by the algorithms themselves. This feature of systems is called ""emergence"" and is pretty much why organisms are NOT algorithms, a bit of how a forest is not just a bunch of trees, it's a bunch of trees working together in a manner different than if they were as numerous get geographically displaced from one another.To explain a system you can't just explain the underlying algorithm, you should also explain how they interact together, in other words the emergent properties of the system and then you have something concrete to work with.

Cremo's work is pure pseudo-science. His bias is clearly told at the beginning of his book when he essentially indicates that he is dismissing evolution, and that he is trying to find proof of the Vedic scriptures (Cremo is a convert to Hinduism.) So essentially, he has his conclusion in mind, and is just endeavoring to cherry-pick evidence to support that conclusion. That is the opposite of how science works. Science looks at all of the available evidence and draws tentative conclusions on the sum of the evidence. That's why mainstream science has progressed by leaps and bounds. I have read Cremo's book and most of the ""findings"" he documents had already been long debunked. (You can even find refutations of many of them on Wikipedia. )  There is a lot of info on the internet and skeptic's websites which debunk Cremo and his ""research.""

It’s too soon to tell!As western Asian who live for 3 decades in western country I can tell that there is a lot of misconception about or around China. This is due to China’s way to do things are unfamiliar to the west  and also due to western mindset and/or arrogances. Forgive me I do not go further analyzing these things.For decades in western world I have “saw and see” a lot of China’s bashing thing e.g. propagandas against China when they are poor country and when they have emerge as powerful country. The myth of Tianmen massacre and neocolonism in Africa. These are the examples of propagandas! Below are the opposite facts about China. Please takes time and be patience to do own researches. China’s world is not so complication and negatively that we westerner wants/likes to see. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2004/09/15/commentary/the-tiananmen-square-massacre-myth/#.W9K242gzaUkhttps://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Gift-Story-China-Africa/dp/0199606293https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNx5DvTIbQE A strong leader or government always play an import role in Chinese society throughout their history. Modern China is not an exception. CCP can kicks Xi out of office or position if they see it as necessary. Why CCP gives Xi so much power and allow Xi consolidates more power to himself? In my mind there has a reasons for it and its obvious!Excluding China’s dynasties periods (which some dynasty fall or been conquered depend on their strength and weakness) when China needs a strong and powerful leader? Answers are when China is/was preparing go to the WAR and /or defense their rights and territory. In modern China’s history there have 3 strong leaders. 1. Mao: The “emperor” in new clothes. He who was powerful enough to unite China under one man strength go to the war and kick out foreign powers from China ja united China under one political system which given Deng a chances to modernizing China. Even Mao had his own flaws in culture revolution period. He was the one that unite Chinese peoples against outsider colonialism. 2. Deng: The little “BIG” man. He was strong leader who was powerful enough rose against old mindset CCP’s elites and fight for modernizing china under his rules which led to these days The Modern China. 3. Xi : he is strong and popular leader in amount mainland Chinese and also in some outsider Chinese he is popular by my experience. He has economic and military power in his hand. He who will “pull” the Chinese together and unite The Han mentality (will needed in near future). He modernize CCP’s military and military techs for a reasons! There will be war between two powerful nation (USA and China). Is the war between them avoidable? I hope so but the truth is USA’s has decline and She never give up her power without a fight (consider the USA war mentality!). The world power is shifting from west pacific back to eastern pacific (mainly China). The Chinese elites knows that and that China is preparing for coming war (trade war and military confrontation). Xi is The China rising power projection CALL!! Xi is not dictators’ call. Where there we like it or not!If world power shift peacefully I’m sure Xi will leave his position without any revolution in China. BTW Chinese elites are very nationalist and own history-central!

Unfortunately, Marxist Catechism describes no modern industrial economy. It does not explain how any modern economy works either. It best fits primitive varieties of hunter-gatherer economies especially ones lowest in division and specialisation of labour. In its best hour, Marxist Catechism described social upheavals in newly industrialising economies, like England's in the mid-1800s, but not how they worked. Capitalism comes in several varieties, which  Wolff never distinguishes. One variety--the oligarchic kind is particularly bad. It takes root in non-democratic societies, where oligarchs own relatively inefficient, rent-seeking firms. Examples abound in Russia and Latin America. . Wolff is clearly unaware that his picture of capitalism is solely in his head and that he paints even that with the broadest brush. How bad is capitalism really? Taxes from private firms and their employees gave Wolff a 35-year, Marxist Catechism-teaching job at U Mass. Then any students of his who tried applying that rubbish in the real world had a hard time. The only things one can do with Marxism are to ignore it and find real work or to sell Marxism. Most Marxism sellers do not get paid. Prof Wolff was very lucky to find a school that would pay him to teach (ie, sell) Marxist Catechism. Would you believe Wolff has a BA from Harvard and a PhD from Yale? What does he do for critical thinking?",Talks at Google,en,0.959078848361969

Why nothing about the feudalistic set up of corporations in the UK in the mid nineteenth century? Why not mention that Karl Marx was funded by the Rothschilds, who were oligarchs? The aristocrats overthrown by the French revolution were replaced by rich oligarchs. So, the social system changed very little. Cooperatives, which are corporations where the employees share ownership with the investors, work very well, and are democratic. Also, no  mention of the financial system – the cause of instability. No mention of the fact that the Great Depression was created deliberately by the banking oligarchs, who combined together to cut credit and reduce the money supply. No mention that the Federal Reserve is a private corporation, which controls America's currency and credit for its own profit. How can this man be a professor of economics without understanding the financial system?He seems to think Capitalism is an imposed system when it's not. Capitalism is the way people have always created wealth – by buying and selling products and services. What is at fault are oligarchical business customs, which should be abolished, and the fact that the medium through which business is conducted – money – is owned and controlled by a small group of international bankers. The solution is to have currency and credit issued by national democratically elected governments.",Talks at Google,en,0.958053469657898

I was an unplanned pregnancy and my survival depended on an abortion law that was in place at the time in Canada, which no longer exists now, in fact we have no law in Canada. Had I been conceived one year later, I may not be here today encouraging people to please acknowledge as human beings the millions who have had and will have the misfortune of being aborted simply because they are not loved and are perceived as having no value. My birthmother had the choice to have an illegal abortion but instead placed me up for adoption and made the sacrifice of self so I could live and be loved by others... this was a loving act. Many people in my life who love me are thankful for my birthmother's sacrifice, including the parents who raised me, my husband and our two children. She not only gave the gift of life but also gave the gift of love. Please choose love, whether that is to keep your baby or to give your baby to others to raise & love. Or choose love if you're a person in the position to show compassion, understanding and support for a woman going through a crisis pregnancy. My son said something very profound once ""If a human fetus was discovered on Mars that fetus would be given much attention, admiration, protection, etc. because it would represent life on Mars. So it basically comes down to where that fetus is located that determines its value."" ... in the womb of a mother who wants & loves the baby, or in the womb of the mother who doesn't.

One might brush off such an attack as unfeasible or unlikely, but it is a potential attack vector and the probability of it being abused grows every day. Some of the largest miner groups have controlled such a large portion of the transactions at peak times by accident. Fortunately for everyone they had no nefarious intentions. There is also the issue that bitcoins are finite in quantity and that bitcoins are literally lost when people forget the password to their wallets or the wallet is lost. While bitcoins can be split up into really small fractions to mitigate this somewhat, this phenomenon might end up making a few individuals very rich, or bitcoins essentially worthless over time.Also to answer your other point, even when you do transactions with companies and people you trust, disagreements and disputes do occur. It doesn't necessarily mean that either party is deliberately trying to fraud the other. There are advantages of having chargebacks just like there are good arguments for a non-regulated currency system.Like all currencies, Bitcoin has some advantages and some disadvantages. If people want Bitcoin to become more popular and easier to use, we should at least be honest about the possible challenges with the system.",Talks at Google,en,0.9786085486412048

Can I ask if you have ever tried to put yourself in the shoes of those whose opinion you oppose? People on the other side genuinely believe that there are millions of innocent children's lives in the balance. What would you do and how would you feel if you genuinely believed a child's life was in danger in the room next-door to you? Can you see how this issue is different from slavery? Pimps and terrorists dehumanize other people so they can treat them as property. That's what makes supporters of slavery guilty of hate speech. By contrast, those who take the pro-life position seek to humanize those whom they believe are already being dehumanized. That's why they view their position as a matter of love.At the same time, I have friends who support abortion who also believe their position is a matter of love. Wouldn't you agree that two sides who believe they are fighting for love should seek to have conversation with one another instead of taking up arms against one another? If two people who believe in love cannot discuss their differences, then what is the point of a multicultural society? It is one thing to silence those who espouse hate (dehumanization a la slavery, racial supremacism, ethnic cleansing, etc.), but another thing entirely to silence those who genuinely believe they are seeking to love. Those of us who belong to the second group have to protect our ability to talk to one another! Otherwise our civilization will become a dictatorship.Thanks for considering what I have to say, Kentucky. I'd be happy to hear any other thoughts you might have in response?All the best,Christopher",Talks at Google,en,0.9293872117996216
