I think the answer is that if we knew from the start there would be no evolving or progress at all..wed be too happy. Its just how we are born into this world of illusion.

His stand-up is great too. You're entitled to not FIND him funny but that doesn't mean he's not funny. His career and achievements in comedy are too great to say he isn't funny. Do you think Ricky gervais is the kind of person to work with someone who he doesn't think he needs for his 2 most successful shows; The Office and Extras.

Labeling him wrong on an opinionated topic. I personally don't agree with him either, but that doesn't make him wrong. I more or less agree with your perspective, but I don't agree with your piss poor attitude. You're right, Nolan himself said there wasn't a complete direction in the making of the film - which makes any discussion on this movie arbitrary.

Issa& co should not have backed down on that issue either if they are not going to back down on any of the others. I think Mary Clarence's character for example is funny at times but also a bit cynically written.Not all Christians are hypocrites.But since they are taking a pop at every1 it is to be expected. To single out that word -when so many other social groups are more heavily parodied in the show-seems extreme to me. I think Issa got her own back with ep 1 series 2 tho' ;-),Talks at Google,en,0.982287347316742

I do bother about this detail, because it´s deeply related to the style in english, not to the strict word-by-word translation. Actually, complex words have more distinguishable patterns that make them easier to recognize. Once you get them, mapping them to pre-defined equivalents in chinese is no-brainer.

このデバイスは人類に貢献する可能性があると私は思う。もし、軽い刺激をあたえる人工皮膚のような手袋や指サックが開発されたら、遠隔操作や遠隔手術を含む医療などのトレーニングにも効果があるだろう。危険物処理トレーニングにも役立つだろう。
また、もし、バーチャルの操作が、実際の手を動かすという発想になれば、理学医療の分野での利用も期待出来る。
さらに、簡単なことだと思うが、倍率をコントロール出来るようにプログラムすれば、ミクロ単位の操作も可能になるだろう。
そう考えるとわくわくするデバイスだ。
勿論、MSが言うように、モバイルやタブレットの分野の応用は一番早いだろう。しかし、これは多くの未来があるデバイスだ。",Microsoft Research,ja,0.9925379157066344
