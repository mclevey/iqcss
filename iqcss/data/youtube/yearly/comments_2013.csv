Let's get this straight: According to John, women need to make sure they don't sabatoge relationships at work and at home. They need to be nurturing. Problem solving doesn't come naturally to them and actually stresses them out. They need to let their man isolate himself and not try to ""interfere with his testosterone restoration process,"" their own well being and needs be damned. Their ""Venution language is convoluted and illogical..."" - I could go on. John says some insightful things about both sexes, sure, but they are hidden under piles of sexism... blatant sexism. In John's perfect world, a woman lets a man do, think, act, and be however he wants while her needs are fulfilled by ""nurturing him."" In this world, a man comes home from work and his wife does too, she cleans the house and makes him dinner while he watches TV so he can ""recharge his testosterone."" This is apparently good for the man and the woman. Well, isn't that convenient?! As a man, I am ashamed to see him represent us this way. This is not equality.",Talks at Google,en,0.9760706424713136

One way to do this is to ""give them a job in the household"" - Men need to learn to understand that an emotional outburst doesn't mean ""she can't handle it"" , but rather that it's just a way to release stress.Men and Women are different, and have different needs.

Suffice it to say that I've been listening to (and making) music for more than 20 years, with a music collection of 20,000+ tracks from Alamaailman Vasarat to Frank Zappa via Gershwin, Orff, Dvorak and John Zorn, Magma and Mike Keneally. Heck, I even built my own music website with an unique tagging system which, for vocals, distinguishes between operatic and theatrical as well as growling, screaming and shouting. But what do I know.I know that operatic vocals are an established art form, but I simply don't see anything useful in them - and I have no problem pointing that out publicly, just as the little girl did in that parable about the Emperor's new clothes.And about the performance in the video: Perhaps I could begin to enjoy it if the two singers had managed to synchronize their vibrato ...",Talks at Google,en,0.9564756155014038

I also made a point to underscore my empathy in that, like you, I once found little to love about the style of singing used in opera. Instead, I wanted to engage you and anyone else watching in a constructive discussion, which (aside from the opening bit) I believe you've done in your response.I focused my comments not on this performance or on your credibility. Even if you were a teenager with little to go on, you'd still be entitled to your opinion, as I pointed out. All the more so considering the amount of effort you have put into amassing a healthy music library that you have catalogued! Again, I am not doubting you may have a finely cultivated taste for some or perhaps many musical genres. And to that I say bravo. But to describe operatic vocals broadly in such disparaging terms betrays a lack of familiarity with the brilliant musicians who devote their entire lives to making great music. You are more than welcome to accept that this is so and say, ""sorry, not for me."" And who could blame you? But you can't hope to make larger more broad claims about ""the death of music,"" as you put it, if your intent is to make some sort of objective truth claim. If that was not your intent, then you might consider rewording it to emphasize how these are merely your opinions.I did appreciate the 2nd comment you made where you walked it back a little bit, but I find it difficult to see someone take to youtube and make such unfounded critical comments on the comment section of the video itself. (Your own personal facebook page would be one of a number of great places where you ""own the space"" and would be free to write whatever you like without it being linked back to the video itself). I know that it would be pretty crushing to me if someone had written something on one of my videos that so thoroughly invalidated my work, and I can't doubt that these artists and their families have seen or will see this video and probably the comments. If we were dealing with a Beyoncé video or something, fine, let'r rip. She's loaded. And she'll never have time to read everything with millions of fans. When you're that big, you're going to have haters. But not all videos on youtube are created equal. These are normal ordinary people who devote their lives to performing great music. The message: no need to be ugly.Also, I will point out that this is live, and the audio is quite clearly not rigged for musical performance. This is a conference room-esque theater that is very clearly dry as a bone and very poorly balanced by a sound engineer not used to managing something like this. This is not to mention that the mics keep peaking! While you claim to have significant knowledge about recorded music, it is clear from your criticism that you are not quite as aware of the the realities of live performance, at least from the perspective of the performers and producers. Recorded music can be dangerous as it can train people to prefer high-gloss production value over the raw, unvarnished verve of live music.Lastly, I will point out an irony. You felt personally attacked by comments that were at the very least, not intended to be personal. While I acknowledge that you certainly did not intend to make it personal, any of the artists shown here who might read your comments will, at the very least, have to swallow hard for a moment if they read your comment, if not take it personally.In short, your tastes and opinions are valid. But your particular choice of criticism may not be.﻿",Talks at Google,en,0.990155816078186

I used to play the guitar and sing in a band, and I know the problems of performing live in improvised environments all too well.But I also know that accurate feedback is extremely important for any artist, and i'm sure that artists who have come as far as being featured in a talks at google video, they know how to take it. BTW: I'm a huge fan of Gershwin, and Rhapsody in Blue is one of my 10 most favorite musical compositions of all time. That's also why I was so shocked to see Porgy and Bess performed in this cold, passionless way that's so distant from the spirit of jazz as pluto is from the sun. I have a lot of sympathy for the performers in the video, and my criticism is mainly targeted at the style - I am convinced that if they were to forget about the rules of classical music for a moment and interpret the music without those confinements, it would be so much better ...﻿",Talks at Google,en,0.9741299748420716

I have done this for years, and I'm in good health, and look amazingly young for my age. I do prefer alot of salads, fruits, and vegetables, but do eat some fast food, and  at hometown buffet weekly. I like food more, in its original state. I take no vitamin supplements or medications, other than ocassional pot once or twice a month. I don't smoke cigarettes anymore.. quit 30 yrs ago. and drink some wine ocassionally. And like a variety of foods, and ocassionaly dark chocolate.  I do whole grains,prefer the taste of brown rice, and eat wheat, love corn and potatoes in all forms. Eat dairy, low fat milk cheese, love eggs, and seeds, and all types of nuts.  My weight is the same as when I was 16 yrs old, and I am 74 yrs old now, and can easily pass for 45.  I have never had face surgery, or any face fillers nothing. I don't do the gym, I do gardening and a few Isometric type exercises using my body weight, and hand mow my lawns front and back. The biggest key to my looking and feeling so good is I enjoy eating whatever I'm eating and doing, or else I don't eat it or do it, and I love variety with everything. I am never bored then.Or addictive to one-type food. One last thing, if I am out eating with friends at a restaurant and their is something I normally don't care for eating, I simply give myself absolution to eat it without any side effects, therefore I don't have any guilt with eating this type of food. So' its giving myself permissipn to eat it without fear attracting a negative experience back..I do this also with everything quietly, most people would not understand, so I don't discuss this  normally.  Its good to see many people are waking up and taking charge of their life, and physical body and connecting with themself on a Higher level of being.. I apply this way of thinking with everything I do, and this is why I believe l ook the way I do. I follow my inner guidance always.. peace  & love  :)",Talks at Google,en,0.9940937161445618

Try 65 million years.What's this crap about ""asking for something in transition""?Ok - the cold and flu virus' have both evolved and both the original and the mutated virus are both still active on the planet at the same time.If you want to see how humans have evolved go and look at the door and ceiling height of an Elizabethan house. Humans were short in those days. That's evolution.Bats have evolved depending on what they feed on. Bats that feed on insects emit sounds, used in echolocation, 1000 times greater than bats that feed on fruit or the blood of larger creatures. That's evolution.Look up the word Vestigial. Some examples.......Humans once had tails as evidenced by the Tail Bone. Some people still carry the gene that makes the tail appear in offspring.Goosebumps are vestigial. In other species they are designed to raise hairs when frightened to make the animal appear more menacing. We lost the hair which made goosebumps  redundant.Wisdom teeth are vestigial. They have no function in a jaw as small as the human jaw but in our ancestors, who had larger jaws, they made sense.Look up polythelia. Some humans still carry the gene that causes extra nipples. These nipples don't grow on the back of your head or on the kneecap. They are always found on the same line you would expect them to be on in a species that has multiple nipples.Having said all that, I'm guessing that you will ignore all that and continue to exist in your closed minded world where the Flintstones is classed as a documentary.",Talks at Google,en,0.9352245330810548

Thus leading me to conclude that you would rather bash a man who's competent in his field than actually contribute a meaningful argument. If you disagree with a scientist you back it up with evidence, not meaningless name calling. It's not a ""believe me or else"" attitude, he's simply confident in the evidence for his claims and when he's wrong he admits it.

That's hardly his fault and is merely a manifestation of your own perceptions. Now in this presumption I'm about to make, I'm sure I could be wrong. However, I think that your perception is derived from a lack of knowledge of science, his accent, and/or either contempt or intimidation of intellectuals and reasoning. Or maybe you have a theory on biology that you have tested and it contradicts most leading scientists in that field. Otherwise I don't see how someone could have garnered the impression that you have of him. Unless of course you're religious. lol.

Prostitution is legal in Thailand and the country is a hotbed full of sex slaves. Chocolate is legal everywhere and Cohen mentions there is a slavery problem in that industry as well. There is nothing you can legalize that will prevent the abuse of people but apathy toward and normalizing of horrible activity will allow it grow. As for Nevada yes there are plenty of sex slaves and the fact that prostitution is legal makes the slaves harder to find and abusers are harder to prosecute because they can hide behind the cover of legal business activities. In any other state massage parlors and strip clubs are used because the legal activities are close to illegal so the illegal blend in more.

As globalization leaves them behind, despite their hue, rage surfaces overtly, despite the racial coding tactics of recent memory. The rage below reveals a wish among racists to throw a violent tantrum, to shoot their way out of the closing coffin of white ""supremacy.""  These hold-outs for a system and view that has historically kept them firmly in check, even applauding a traditionally white ruling class indifferent to them, shows the crazy. Now they start to see their skin priviledges are no longer quite the attraction they once seemed, though never really were, to the ruling class who granted only a puny berth above people of color, not social or economic parity. In other words NOCD still applies, whatever the skin color. Hence the hysteria, as corporate globalization leaves all but the very rich behind. Hence the attempt to force the outside into line with their warped mentalities through faux news and ruling-class-directed politics...so far.

Proof please for risking a nuclear meltdown.13. aviation - safest ever now Zion Schmidt says - so why are we having more aviation accidents than ever? The problem is a trust based one and not a fact based one. So the average person must do something vague here. Then he differentiates the audience by referring them as the smart ones. --So this propaganda piece is designed for the 'smart ones' who don't bother doing their own homework so they can be easily lied to.

But I think the best adjective to describe you is ignorant. Get over your white guilt. NO one is checking for you! White people who are not racist do not have time to comment on YouTube.

This stood out to me because I feel like she is a great singer and the album is great which is true.

这篇论文引起来国际关注，令联合国制裁中国这个联合国常任理事国，换句话说，中国政府自已同意批准制裁自已，傅平的能力真巨大！
傅平在给中国共产党带来这么严重的损害的情况下，中国共产党居然不是象魏京生、陈光诚、王丹那样将她关押起来十年八载，而且在邓小平的亲自过问下，三后以后就释放了她，并给她一本护照，将她驱赶出中国，让她去美国上大学！！
啊，看到这里，我不禁高呼中国共产党真伟 大！对傅平太优待了，怪不得傅平出自传来说明这一切
傅平以一个平民的身份能得到中国共产党这么优厚的待遇，怪不得她要写自传说这一切说出来了，得了别人的好处，的确是要表达谢意的，你们谁还敢说傅平是出自传抹黑中国共产党呢？
事实上，傅平是给中国歌颂中国共产党啊！
在这个世界上，只有魏京生、王丹、陈光诚这样的人才会抹黑中国共产党的，傅平绝对不会！！！

中国人的生日是吃红鸡蛋及长寿面的，58年出生的傅平到懂事时已是大饥荒之后，全国陷入节约粮食的环境中，而当时中共政府更是将整个西方国家视为死敌的，凡跟西方国家沾点边的事与物都禁止中国人使用及学习的。一律被批判成资产阶级的东西，全中国人天天批判西方国家的。
我不知58年出生的傅平从那里知道生日是吹腊烛，切蛋糕庆祝的？傅平不单止知道，并吃上生日蛋糕庆祝生日，

中共自49年夺权发一直不停的发动政治运动，对有海外关系的人一律严格审查，其中最著名的：三反五反运动，清理阶级队伍运动。对整个社会进行清洗，凡有海外亲属关系的人一律 严加审查，所以当时的人就是有海外亲属也不敢承认的，而且出入境早就给切断，有军警把守。
我是广州人，我们广东省大从59年大饥荒开始，大量的饥民逃去香港，中国的军警在罗湖边境架起机关枪，凡发现偷越国境者一律开枪，这段历史随便在网上可以查证，在如果气氛紧张的情况下，傅平的上海爸爸还可以在香港订造西服，可见共产党是专门批准他去香港 订造洋服的。

如要迁移户口，必须要工作单位同意、街道办事处同意、对方接收你的所在地区的派出所同意，也就是说，当时的中国人要迁移居住地必须要经过重重关卡方可迁移，这个迁移还要是因为工作的需要这个原因才可以，私人理由是不批准的，为什么这么严厉？
因为在当时的中国，粮食是实行配给制，每个居民凭户口证明到当地的粮油店领取每月的粮食，而粮食在当时是紧缺品，所以对户口管制极度严格。
傅平如果只为姑母收养而迁移户口去全国最大的城市上海是难度超高的，但她可以。
为什么说她可以？因为中国小孩7岁上学的，凭户口本到小学报读的，她能在上海上学，说明她的户口已迁到上海了

中国在61年大饥荒之后实行粮食配给制度，成年人每人每月28市斤粮食，20克（二两）食油，全中国人民处在半饥饱中。
傅平的上海妈妈是一位超级主妇，据书中讲，妈妈在街道工厂工作，是全职工作，也就是说妈妈每天下班后回家做八菜一汤及四个前菜，
当时中国人煮食是用一种叫蜂窝煤炉的炉子煮食，靠燃烧一个蜂窝煤来煮八菜一汤及四个前菜，居然可以赶在晚餐前煮好，让一家人吃上晚饭，超人！这还不包括上海妈妈下班后还要去菜市场买菜，当年家里没有冰箱的，上海的夏天气温高达38度，菜与肉不可能提前一，二天时间买的，会发臭，变质的
同时，每人每月20克食油可以每晚炒这么多菜，不知上海妈妈怎样炒菜的呢？

Part of the fun was, that Eric Schmidt clearly had no chance nor intention to really challenge Stephen Colbert on his views or ways of promoting his alter ego.

The author's reaction to this point during the Q&A was more defensive than it should have been. But that doesn't prove the random walk theory. If it did, people like Buffet wouldn't exist.",Talks at Google,en,0.9780302047729492

U would have a drink with Jefferson because you wrote a book about him. And why write a book  about Jeff and not say, Washington or Hamilton?  Well, aside from countless bios of this formidable founding fathers, there is the 'good looks factor'. Sure Hamilton is better looking than Jeff, but honestly-Ham looks like a girly pretty guy- Jeff is more rugged and manly. Not to mention, Jefferson is Mr. Controversial. A great subject for a book.  He preached abolition yet he owned slaves. (not to mention slept with Sally and produced a brood) He quoted the bible several times yet he was agnostic or at least deity. Personally, I am looking forward to read the book, I hope your wrote more about the relationship between Ham and Jeff--via Washington.  H & J would bicker over attention for Washington like two mistresses and W would always have to please each one separately.

He states that when you commit suicide in limbo, you emerge one dream layer up. He cites the scene with Ariadne and Fischer jumping off the building when all if the kicks are about to go off. This isn't what happens though. Ariadne and Fischer never hit the ground. The point of them jumping is not to die, but to fall. They're creating a kick to wake themselves from the dream. This explains why they only go one layer up. When you have that falling sensation in a dream, you wake up to wherever you were having that dream. It is shown in the film that they both wake up before hitting the ground. There's even a remark that Ariadne makes about needing to create a kick and gravity being the only available tool.This nullifies the point that Cobb could be in Saido's dream at the end when he's with his kids, because that's not where he'd end up if they shot themselves in limbo.

Think of the issue of false negatives in drug tests: that the result is negative doesn't mean the sample doesn't contain any drugs. Likewise the absence of something that is presumably absent in the real world can't prove he's not a dream, even though the presence of the ring could indicate he's in a dream (of his own or somebody else's).I think the important point is not that it is most likely all a dream (i.e. nobody was awake throughout the course of the story in the first place), but that there is no absolute proof one way or the other, we can only pick up on all of the hints and derive a conclusion from that.In a way this supports one of the early explanations of the ending: it doesn't matter whether the top will fall, it only matters that Cobb doesn't care. Coob's doubt of what is real and what is just a dream is a core element of the movie. If the movie itself is meant to be ambiguous about whether anything in it is ""real"", that means the audience gets to experience the same doubt as Cobb.Add to that the explanation that the way dreams are fabricated in the movie strongly resembles how movies are made in the real world and you get to the crux of the presentation: just like Cobb (via the dream) ""incepted"" the idea that they're living in a dream in Mal, Nolan (via the movie) ""incepts"" the idea that we, the audience, may be living in a dream in us.This is pretty meta, but I think it fits with what Nolan has done with his previous movies: there's the story as it is being narrated in the movie, the (potentially unknowable) story as the characters portrayed in that movie may actually be experiencing it, and the story Nolan wants to tell you through the movie itself.Either Nolan is a great director, or his fans are simply really good at finding deep meaning in his work. Personally, I think the former is the case, but without being Nolan, he's making it impossible to tell -- and I think that, too, is intentional.",Talks at Google,en,0.9886682629585266

Furthermore it is my belief that legal action only serves as a band-aid solution to problems when no technical solution is immediately realized. Thus understanding that the underlying issue is the money influence within our political system, especially in the realm of campaign finance, my question then becomes what types of technical solutions can create the conditions under which money and its influence over our politicians is no longer relevant?To answer that question I am first inclined to ask another. In the age of information, where we have immediate access to all forms of media ranging from the written word to video representations, and where we have the proportionate ability to immediately distribute those same forms of media just as readily; All for little more than the price of a computer and a video camera. Why is it that the election process, In the hitherto mentioned age of information, requires so much money in the first place? Why is it so expensive to run a campaign?I find this question strikingly hard to answer. I can understand the cost associated with travel, of booking a venue and of buying a few billboards. But all these things seem to me to add up to a total that dwarfs in comparison to the amount of money these candidates accept in campaign contributions. There seems to be some fundamental disconnect, the campaign system is incredibly inefficient, and appears to be corrupting by its very nature.So then the question becomes, how can we implement recent advents of technology into the election process that would dramatically cut the cost of running for office?My answer:Create an open platform (.gov website) for candidates running for office to obtain campaign finance directly from the electorate. Candidates would post their political platform, their credentials, their past voting records, basically all information relevant for the public to make an informed decision. But here in my view is the interesting bit, every dollar contributed through this website can be tracked and represented in some sort of mathematical diagram and compared to the total amount received by the candidate for his/her campaign. If such a system were in place and were socially recognized as the authority in matters relating to a campaign, we would be able to see what groups have financed each politician. you would be able to see some thing like, this politician has received (x) amount of campaign dollars by undisclosed sources and (y) amount of campaign dollars by disclosed sources. From this you would be able to figure out what percentage of the total amount received comes from sources that are open about their motivations, which in essence would be a measure of how much you can trust a specific politician.The beauty in a solution like this is that it requires no reform on a legislative level. All that is required is a consensus be reached by the people to value openness and honesty in our political leaders.It seems to me that such a website if widely adopted by the public would create a platform that enables a politician to voice their ideas and explain their proposed policies for nearly no money at all, effectively restricting the influence money has over campaigns in the first place..........................................................I would greatly appreciate any feedback.",Talks at Google,en,0.9416322112083436

The only advice I can give, based on my own life experience, is to try to understand the predetermination of your own perception. By understanding the inherent bias in your own thinking (we all have this) you are able to understand the world better, because you begin to see some of the ways in which you filter the external environment and the ways in which your perception is but a colored vision of an objective reality.

Whether cross-dressing does anything for you is not all that relevant here. The purpose of empathy is using our mirror neurons and imagination to understand others, not project our own preferences or state of being on the environment.

Insufficient understanding of the neuro-physiological underpinnings of sexual preferences or social normative relics, left within our society through religious norms and values that formed an important source, wanted or not, for society's thinking about 'right vs wrong' over the past few millennia.

With that, we can see that we have an opportunity here to expand both our personal thinking and society's development, by enhancing our level of tolerance towards society's outliers. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9093974828720092

You question why can be answered from a natural or a normative perspective. The natural approach is that cross-dressing is the result of someone's genetic and epi-genetic make-up (where make-up is a fitting choice of words..), which puts the behavior beyond the individuals realm of conscious choice and therefore responsibility. 
From a normative stance point we can say that cross-dressing is only 'abnormal' because of the current norms held in society. Such norms may be the result of  ",Talks at Google,en,0.9416595101356506

Deserve our respect. All the more when their persona does not overlap with society's current 'norm' or range of acceptable behavior around the societal average (which is what norms essentially are). 
I realize that last bit is more of a normative statement than a clear answer towards understanding why, I hope you'll find it useful nonetheless. 

Does that answer your question or at least provide you with a useful insight into my perspective on how the situation could be seen?

Where our 'self' is a momentary expression of our (sub)conscious values and beliefs, that reach well beyond our conscious mind. 
In its simplest form I would answer your question of 'why is he a transvestite?' by saying: because it expresses the person he feels he naturally is and because he is brave enough to align his outward actions with being his intuitively felt 'self'.

A) Our genetics and B) our epigenetics (the effect of environmental stimuli on the expression of certain genes as we go through life, specifically during the formative years before we reach the age of 24).

Since this is her job also. If you're getting that nervous to interview someone then why interview her? She could of just met her backstage instead if she couldn't handle it. I understand taking up the chance if you have it but you need to distance yourself some to keep it professional. By her laughing so much it felt more like a mock interview rather than someone who was taking in what Gaga said. ,Talks at Google,en,0.9910981059074402

I'm glad it's questions from fans though because I don't think the interviewer could of pulled her weight on her own.

I can sort of get why it could be something cool with examples like 0:41 and with the snow and stars, because it is not distracting you from the actual game.  But for now it is not enough to keep me convinced this is a good idea.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9941565990447998

You lose in immediacy and simplicity for some special effects.
Also if you use this with kinect, you must be careful not to cover projector light.

Anyway, I've found several computers from people on eBay within the price range which I said, all of which are almost the same as what I got.

So your point of it being rare is void as well as the point earlier about how graphics cards cost the same as the entire thing.
The only point a GPU would cost £300 is if you're being an idiot buying it either off the company which made it or off someone scamming you shitless.

You know what would be a good idea for something to use with your video games console? SOME FUCKING VIDEO GAMES.

WHERE THE VIDEO GAMES MICROSOFT? REMEMBER WHEN YOU BOUGHT A CONSOLE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES? NOT BUY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF CHEAPY GIMMICKY PLASTIC SHIT.
