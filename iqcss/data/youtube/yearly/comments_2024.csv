It explores the key dimensions that differentiate thesemodels, focusing on size, training data, distillation techniques, andoptimization strategies. The talk offers a framework for understandingthe strengths and limitations of various LLMs and helps viewersnavigate the rapidly evolving landscape of this technology.Summary with TimestampsIntroduction (0:04)- This talk offers an overview of LLMs and a framework for understanding their differences.About the Speaker (1:00)- Nick Sorros studied Computing at Imperial College and has worked as a data scientist and AI specialist.- He co-founded MantisNLP, a consultancy specializing in custom AI solutions.LLM Training Stages (3:03)- Pre-training: Most time and compute intensive stage, where the model learns to predict the next token.- Instruction Fine-tuning: Teaching the model to follow specific instructions.- Preference Learning: Indicating which answers are more relevant.- Alignment: Combining instruction fine-tuning and preference learning to align the LLM's behavior.- Extending Context Window: Increasing the model's memory capacity (e.g., Gemini).- Optimizations: Improving data and training efficiency (e.g., GPT Turbo).Key Dimensions of LLM Differences (6:25)- Model Size: Larger models generally perform better, but with diminishing returns.- Training Data: More data leads to better performance, but with a trade-off in compute cost.- Distillation: Using a larger ""teacher"" model to train a smaller ""student"" model.- Optimizations: Fine-tuning hyperparameters and other techniques to improve performance.Model Size and Scaling Laws (7:41)- Scaling laws predict model performance based on size and training data.- Pre-ChatGPT era focused on increasing model size, leading to undertrained models.- Chinchilla paper introduced a new scaling law emphasizing data size.Importance of Data Size (14:35)- Post-Chinchilla LLMs prioritize increasing training data, leading to better performance.- There is a trade-off between model size and data size for inference efficiency.- Smaller models require exponentially more data to achieve similar performance.Distillation Techniques (22:54)- Distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model.- Modern distillation focuses on instruction fine-tuning and preference learning.- Techniques include using ChatGPT conversations, automatically generated instruction sets, and complex examples.- Distilled models often have restricted licenses due to reliance on teacher models.- Phi (from Microsoft) is an exception, trained from scratch with textbook-like examples and a commercial license.Optimizations (33:52)- Optimizations target data sets used for instruction fine-tuning and preference learning.- Examples include improving data diversity (Zephyr) and removing noise (Notus).- Other optimizations include using different activation functions, attention mechanisms, and hyperparameters.Conclusion (37:29)- This talk provides a framework for understanding the differences between LLMs.- Model size, training data, distillation, and optimizations are key factors to consider.- The LLM landscape is rapidly evolving, with new models and techniques emerging constantly.disclaimer: i used gemini 1.5 pro to summarize the transcript",PyData,en,0.941884696483612

Dr. Gorin discusses how these techniques are being used to address challenges ranging from early disease diagnosis to modeling behavior and neural networks. He examines the outcomes achieved and their impact on brain science methodologies, as well as key libraries and their role in data analysis. The talk concludes with a demonstration of using the NE learn toolbox for fMRI data analysis and predicting visual stimuli based on brain activity.SummaryPrevalent Machine Learning Methods in Neuroscience* 0:06: ICA and PCA are commonly used to clean and decompose EEG and MEG signals, removing artifacts and isolating brain activity components.* 1:35: CSP (Common Spatial Pattern) helps separate different sources of signals in BCI applications, allowing focus on specific brain activity patterns for control purposes.* 7:29: ISC (Inter-Subject Correlation) is used to assess how attentively a group of people watched a video by analyzing similarities in their brain activity.Applications of AI in Neuroscience* 11:08: BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) research utilizes various AI methods to improve the effectiveness and precision of brain-controlled devices.* 13:59: AI is being used in near-imaging techniques to predict what a person sees, reconstruct images based on brain activity, and enhance the resolution of medical images.* 22:10: AI models are being developed to diagnose various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors, using functional and structural brain connectivity data.* 24:32: AI offers potential for modeling human behavior based on brain activity, which could be used to understand child behavior or predict student performance.Challenges and Opportunities* 36:48: A major challenge is the need for large, standardized datasets for training and validating AI models, requiring collaboration between research groups.* 46:21: Neuroscience data presents unique challenges, including non-linearity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and difficulty interpreting features, requiring robust and interpretable models.* 53:10: The ecological validity of lab-based neuroimaging studies is limited, and future research needs to explore ways to study brain activity in real-life settings.Tools and Resources* 26:11: Nilearn is a free and open-source toolbox focused on fMRI data analysis, offering various decoders and functions for analyzing brain activity.Future Directions* 37:58: Big data science and collaboration are crucial for advancing AI applications in neurobiology.* 50:01: Integrating expertise from data scientists, psychologists, and biologists is essential for developing effective and interpretable AI models in neuroscience.Disclaimer: I used gemini 1.5 pro (2024.03.27) to summarize thevideo transcript.

I have no hands-on experience with DuckDB, but abstracted interfaces separate from the underlying DB implementation is that it can be shared between different kinds of data assets. This can facilitate situations where there are multiple types of data sources and targets (eg. data coming from streams, operational databases or data warehouses), and allows for more easy migration between DB implementations. Also, these interfaces allow you to abstract away commonly required interactions with organisation specific infrastructure.

Some of them are managers who invariably find themselves doing some analysis on a lot of data and one of them told me using DuckDB turned out to be a game changer as he no longer had to ask a developer to load into an RDBMS before he could do anything. I received a similar feedback from many others later. I use it every day myself at various levels and was pleasantly surprised to see some of the topics covered in this presentation I already use. Using it with a combination of other technologies such as DASK and Polars within a Python code take the experience to a whole different level. A good use case is when you do have to do some analysis on lots of data - from a database or a bunch of other adhoc files and you do not want to stress your main RDBMS and rather want to do it on your own laptop running a standalone Python program. This is where a combination of Python and DuckDB  (and maybe Polars and DASK) could be hugely efficient. Features such as running a SQL query on Pandas data frame are brilliant. Another example is when you have a bunch of CSV (or parquet/json) files and you just want to run a query on them by joining them on some columns without going to to the trouble of loading into an RDBMS or even converting them into a data frame first. and the list goes on.......Highly recommended...!!,PyData,en,0.9921109676361084

Kishan Manani discussesthe advantages of using machine learning for forecasting, includingits ability to handle complex data structures and incorporateexogenous variables. He then dives into the specifics of featureengineering for time series, covering topics like lag features, windowfeatures, and static features. The talk emphasizes the importance ofavoiding data leakage and highlights the differences between machinelearning workflows for classification/regression and forecastingtasks. Finally, Manani introduces useful libraries like Darts andsktime that facilitate time series forecasting with tabular data andprovides practical examples.SummaryWhy use machine learning for forecasting? (1:25)- Machine learning models can learn across many related time series.- They can effectively incorporate exogenous variables.- They offer access to techniques like sample weights and custom loss functions.Don't neglect simple baselines though! (3:45)- Simple statistical models can be surprisingly effective.- Ensure the uplift from machine learning justifies the added complexity.Forecasting with machine learning (4:15)- Convert time series data into a table with features and a target variable.- Use past values of the target variable as features, ensuring no data leakage from the future.- Include features with known past and future values (e.g., marketing spend).- Handle features with only past values (e.g., weather) by using alternative forecasts or lagged versions.- Consider static features (metadata) to capture differences between groups of time series.Multi-step forecasting (8:07)- Direct forecasting: Train separate models for each forecast step.- Recursive forecasting: Train a one-step ahead model and use it repeatedly, plugging forecasts back into the target series.Cross-validation: Tabular vs Time series (11:32)- Randomly splitting data is inappropriate for time series due to temporal dependence.- Split data by time, replicating the forecasting process for accurate performance evaluation.Machine learning workflow (13:00)- Time series forecasting workflow differs significantly from classification/regression tasks.- Feature engineering and handling vary at predict time depending on the multi-step forecasting approach.Feature engineering for time series forecasting (14:47)- Lag features: Use past values of target and features, including seasonal lags.- Window features: Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) over past windows.- Nested window features: Capture differences in various time scales.- Static features: Encode categorical metadata using target encoding, being mindful of potential target leakage.Overview of some useful libraries (27:01)- tsfresh: Creates numerous time series features from a data frame.- Darts and sktime: Facilitate forecasting with tabular data and offer functionalities like recursive forecasting and time series cross-validation.Forecasting with tabular data using Darts (28:04)- Example demonstrates forecasting with lag features and future known features on single and multiple time series.disclaimer: i used gemini 1.5 pro to summarize the youtube transcript.",PyData,en,0.9790584444999696

It covers thefundamental concepts of Bayesian statistics, including priordistributions, likelihood functions, and posterior distributions. Thetutorial also explains Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods,specifically the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), used to approximateposterior distributions. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance ofmodel checking and demonstrates techniques for assessing convergenceand goodness of fit. The tutorial concludes with examples of buildingand analyzing models in PyMC, including predicting the outcomes ofsporting events.SummaryIntroduction (0:03)- This tutorial is intended for data scientists and analysts interested in applying Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming.- No prior knowledge of statistics, machine learning, or Python is assumed.- The tutorial provides a high-level overview of Bayesian statistics, probabilistic programming, and PyMC.Probabilistic Programming (1:24)- Probabilistic programming involves writing programs with outputs partially determined by random numbers.- It allows for specifying statistical models using stochastic language primitives like probability distributions.- The main purpose of probabilistic programming is to facilitate Bayesian inference.What is Bayes? (3:30)- Bayesian statistics uses probability models to make inferences from data about unknown quantities.- It involves updating prior beliefs based on observed data to obtain posterior distributions.- Bayes' formula is the foundation of Bayesian inference.Why Bayes? (4:39)- Bayesian inference is attractive due to its utility and conceptual simplicity.- It allows for incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty in estimates and predictions.Prior distribution (6:51)- Prior distributions quantify uncertainty in unknown variables before observing data.- Uninformative priors can be used when little is known beforehand.- Informative priors can be based on domain knowledge or previous data.Likelihood function (8:13)- The likelihood function describes how the data relates to the model.- It is a probability distribution conditioned on the model and observed data.- Different likelihood functions are appropriate for different types of data (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson).Infer values for latent variables (9:34)- Bayesian inference combines prior and likelihood information to generate the posterior distribution.- The posterior distribution represents updated knowledge about unknown variables after observing data.- Calculating the posterior distribution often requires numerical methods due to the complexity of integration.Probabilistic programming in Python (16:48)- Several probabilistic programming libraries are available in Python, including PyMC, Stan, Pyro, and TensorFlow Probability.- PyMC is specifically designed for fitting Bayesian statistical models using MCMC methods.PyMC and its features (17:29)- PyMC provides various features for Bayesian modeling, including:- Built-in statistical distributions- Tools for output analysis and plotting- Extensibility for custom distributions and algorithms- GPU support and different computational backendsExample: Building models in PyMC (22:30)- The tutorial demonstrates building a changepoint model in PyMC to analyze baseball spin rate data.- The model estimates the changepoint and mean spin rates before and after the sticky stuff crackdown.- The example showcases specifying stochastic and deterministic variables, priors, likelihoods, and running MCMC sampling.Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian approximation (41:47)- MCMC methods are used to approximate posterior distributions by simulating a Markov chain.- The simulated chain converges to the posterior distribution as its stationary distribution.- Metropolis sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) are two MCMC algorithms.Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (48:03)- HMC uses gradient information to efficiently explore the posterior distribution.- It simulates a physical analogy of a particle moving through the parameter space.- The No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is an improved HMC algorithm that automatically tunes parameters.Example: Markov Chain Monte Carlo in PyMC (53:06)- The tutorial demonstrates fitting a model for predicting rugby scores using MCMC in PyMC.- The example showcases specifying priors, likelihoods, running MCMC sampling, and analyzing the results.Model checking (1:11:58)- Model checking is crucial to ensure the validity of the fitted model.- It involves assessing convergence diagnostics and goodness of fit.Convergence diagnostics (1:12:10)- Convergence diagnostics verify whether the MCMC algorithm has effectively explored the posterior distribution.- Techniques include visually inspecting trace plots, checking for divergences, analyzing energy plots, and calculating potential scale reduction (R-hat) statistics.Goodness of fit (1:17:58)- Goodness of fit assesses how well the model fits the observed data.- The posterior predictive distribution is used to compare model predictions with the data.- Visualizations like cumulative distribution plots can help evaluate goodness of fit.Making predictions (1:20:43)- PyMC allows for making predictions with fitted models by updating the data and sampling from the posterior predictive distribution.- The tutorial demonstrates predicting the outcome of a rugby match between Wales and England.Conclusion- The tutorial concludes by encouraging further exploration of Bayesian modeling with PyMC and suggesting additional resources.disclaimer: i used gemini 1.5 pro to summarize the youtube transcript.",PyData,en,0.9497200846672058

The audience engagement was unnecessary and derailed an efficient trajectory towards the fundamental points being communicated, and none of the topic that were touched on (such as the notion that controlling for certain variables in a structure can actually introduce confounding snd biases that didnt exist prior to that control) were motivated by examples. The statements were just sort of dropped on the floor and left to find their own home in the audiences interpretations.

He covers topics such as choosing the rightdata types, chaining operations, avoiding mutation, when to use apply,and mastering aggregation. Through practical examples and codedemonstrations, Matt emphasizes the importance of writing clean,readable, and efficient Pandas code.Summary:PyData Salt Lake City Intro (0:14)- The speaker series has attracted attendees from around the world.- The talk will focus on Pandas and its unique connection to Salt Lake City.What is Pandas? (0:46)- Pandas is built on top of NumPy and Matplotlib, both of which were created by Travis Oliphant, organizer of PyData Salt Lake City.- These packages are supported by NumFOCUS, which promotes open-source data tools.- PyData is a global community of developers and users of open-source data tools.Matt Harrison Speaker Intro (4:37)- Matt is a leader in the data science world and author of popular Pandas books.- He is an experienced instructor and trainer, and actively contributes to the Python community.How to use Pandas Effectively (8:00)Data types in pandas library (13:36):- Pandas uses NumPy to efficiently represent data types and perform operations.- Common data types include integers, floats, and objects.- Choosing the right data type can significantly impact memory usage and performance.Writing chain method code (18:19):- Chaining operations together improves readability and avoids intermediate variables.- This approach makes code look like a recipe and simplifies debugging.- Parentheses can be used to further improve readability.Memory Usage of a Data frame (17:36):- Use memory_usage(deep=True) to inspect memory usage of each column.- Converting columns to appropriate data types can save memory.Object dtypes in pandas (27:53):- Object columns often contain categorical data that can be converted to category type for memory efficiency.- Value counts can be used to identify categorical data and missing values.Date dtypes in pandas (37:19):- Convert date columns to datetime format using to_datetime.- Be aware of potential issues like time zones and adjust accordingly.Pandas chaining recipe (44:02)- Chaining, also known as flow programming, leverages the fact that most Pandas operations return new objects.- This allows for concise and readable code, avoiding intermediate variables and potential bugs.- Use the pipe method for operations that cannot be chained directly.Don't Mutate (52:14)- Avoid using inplace=True as it often doesn't actually save memory and hinders chaining.- Chaining ensures code clarity and avoids potential bugs related to mutation.Don't Apply (56:13)- While apply allows applying functions to data, it is often slower than vectorized operations.- For numeric processing, avoid apply and use vectorized operations or methods like where and np.select.- String operations are generally slower in Pandas, but using methods like isin can still be more efficient than apply.Master Aggregation (1:06:07)- Aggregation is crucial for summarizing data and generating reports.- Pandas groupby allows for efficient aggregation by different functions.- Be mindful of the order of operations when using groupby to optimize performance.- Hierarchical indexes and columns can be created with groupby, but can be cumbersome to work with.- Use unstack to convert hierarchical indexes to columns for easier plotting and manipulation.- Plotting aggregated data is straightforward with Pandas and Matplotlib.- Use techniques like rolling averages to smooth out plots.Summary (1:24:35)- Choosing the right data types, chaining operations, avoiding mutation, using vectorized operations, and mastering aggregation are key to using Pandas effectively.- These practices lead to cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code.disclaimer: i used gemini 1.5 pro to summarize the youtube transcript.",PyData,en,0.9711520075798036

Reading your question, to me that sounds more to a local sensitivity analysis (LSA) related problem, which is even much simpler to run. In the case of Sobol or Morris methods, one usually is dealing with Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), and the investigation relies mainly on the contributions of model input uncertainty to model output uncertainty. In your case you can use Matrix Perturbation theory (The Computational Structure of Life Cycle Assessment, by Heijungs and Sangwon), or even simpler, you can run OAT One-factor-at-a-time by choosing one input, varying it by 1%  while the remaing inputs are constant, run the model and see the effect of this 1% on the model output interested. Than repeat the procedure for the remaing parameters. I hope it helps. If you want to increase the reliability of your model, then move forward to Morris and Sobol, and for this you need an statistical analysis of the input because it is necessary the ranges (standard deviation) to see the variability of the input.",PyData,en,0.9688733220100404

Being in nature, listening to birds chirping,  watching plants and flowers bloom can be a major source of joy. Nature has so many colors (changing throughout the year), calming sounds (e.g. a sound of stream) and scents that have healing properties. Looking at a green color can help relax the eyes. Gardening, hiking, horseback riding, and golfing can be so beneficial, so is visiting national and state parks. Nature can be a major source of inspiration, e.g. for poetry and paintings, even music.

It will go back and forth and even say contradicting things. Observe how it is Judging,  Labeling,  Analyzing,  Assessing,  Planning,  Reacting (without knowing the complete truth). It never stops and that is the nature of our Thinking Mind....Past or Future, seldom IN THE MOMENT. The key is to become AWARE of its nature and you will take a step closer to freedom. Watching the thoughts Come and Go, OBSERVE the Space between the Thoughts & The Silence underneath the Noise.It is absolutely OK we get pulled into by The Thinking Mind, it will happen frequently.  The TIP is that each time when you realise that you have been pulled under, just be Aware and Mindful. It's like a swimmer who come up for air and gets pulled under again. Overtime with consistent practice of oberving Mindfulness and Awareness ...thoughts will have less control on us. We will definitely get pulled under by our thoughts again and again but by observing, being  aware each time we will spend less time under and breathe more Air. Remember it's a continuous battle between our Conscious and Unconscious Mind ( which governs our thoughts and actions 95% and makes us on Auto Pilot Mode from Childhood itself).",Talks at Google,en,0.9642201066017152

Emma Roberts portrayed the Florida girl vibrantly - alligator wrestling Rex Simpson who was so  adorably named Rex since she walked like a dinosaur as a child. I loved the scene where she sat with her mother watching the shuttle launch and saying with certainty that she would be an astronaut. Emma Roberts made us live Rex Simpson in this movie.

Predicting better than guessing is generally sufficient to drive significant improvements to the bottom line. However, getting machine learning models deployed into production where they can actually deliver business value remains a major challenge. Most new machine learning projects fail to make it to deployment. There is a disconnect between the data scientists building the models and the business stakeholders who need to understand, approve and integrate the models. Data scientists view it as a technology project while business professionals think the technical details can be delegated. Both sides are missing the bigger picture of what it takes to successfully deploy machine learning.What's needed is a well-established organizational framework and process for running machine learning projects from conception through to deployment. Siegel calls this ""BizML"" - a paradigm that empowers business professionals while providing a strategic framework for data professionals. It requires deep collaboration between both sides throughout the end-to-end project lifecycle.The BizML playbook consists of 6 key steps:1. Define the deployment goal - What will be predicted and what will be done with those predictions? Plan for deployment from the start.2. Define the prediction objective - Get specific about exactly what the model will predict, with input from business stakeholders. 3. Determine the technical and business metrics - How will model performance and business value be measured? Set targets that must be hit to justify deployment.4. Prepare the data 5. Train the model on the data6. Deploy the model into operations to deliver business valueThe first 3 steps require close collaboration with business stakeholders who need to develop a ""semi-technical"" understanding of how machine learning works - what's predicted, how well, and what's done about it. This level of understanding is crucial for business buy-in and successful deployment. Most of the focus tends to be on step 5, the ""cool"" and intellectually appealing work of training the machine learning model. But the real payoff comes in step 6 - deployment. That's where predictive models get integrated into operations to actually change and improve business decisions and processes. Deployment is where most projects get stuck today.To drive deployment, machine learning performance needs to be evaluated not just using abstract technical metrics like accuracy, but in terms of concrete business metrics like profit, revenue, and cost savings. Translating model performance into business impact requires close collaboration with stakeholders and specialized tools to forecast and visualize how the model will perform under different deployment scenarios. Some examples of impactful machine learning deployments that Siegel highlighted:- UPS predicts tomorrow's package deliveries to optimize truck loading and routing, saving 185 million miles, $350M, and 185,000 metric tons of emissions per year- Banks like Chase predict which mortgage holders are likely to defect so they can proactively intervene with retention offers - Insurance companies like Healthcare.gov predict risk at the individual level to optimize coverage and pricing- Retailers use machine learning to optimize which customers to target with marketing based on likelihood to buyThe potential applications are vast, spanning fraud detection, credit risk, equipment maintenance, site selection, and much more. Machine learning use cases exist in every industry. The limiting factor is not the technology itself, but the organizational processes and collaboration required to get it deployed.In summary, the key to unlocking machine learning's immense value is mastering the rare art of deployment. That requires establishing an organizational paradigm Siegel calls BizML, with business and technical professionals collaborating closely across a 6-step deployment-focused project lifecycle. By empowering stakeholders with a ""semi-technical"" understanding of machine learning fundamentals and evaluating models in terms of business metrics, not just technical ones, organizations can connect the dots from data science to measurable business impact. Those that do stand to reap huge rewards, optimizing operations and decision-making at scale through the power of prediction. But it takes a concerted focus on deployment, not just model development, to get there. That's the message of Siegel's AI Playbook.A few other interesting points and examples from the talk:- Predicting curly fry affinity on Facebook correlates with intelligence, while skipping breakfast correlates with heart disease risk for certain males, likely as a proxy for lifestyle- A Fortune 500 software company improved novice and low-skilled customer service agent performance by 34% using generative AI to assist with responses - Ali Financial Bank cut marketing creative development time by 34% using generative AI- Generative AI has major potential but is overhyped by a factor of 10-20x in Siegel's view; it is not a path to artificial general intelligence (AGI)- Organizations should consider designing operations and data collection from the ground up around eventual machine learning use cases rather than treating ML as an afterthought- Deploying even simple predictive models like decision trees can yield major business value if they predict the right objective- The biggest technical challenge is often preparing the data in a meaningful way for machine learning, not the model training itself- There is a huge education opportunity and need around giving business professionals and data scientists the ""semi-technical"" foundational understanding required to collaborate on end-to-end machine learning deploymentsIn conclusion, predictive machine learning presents immense opportunities to optimize operations and decision-making across sectors. But deployment, not just development, must be the focus. Through deep business-technical collaboration following a paradigm like BizML, organizations can connect machine learning investments to real-world impact. The limiting factor is not the technology itself but the organizational processes required to deploy it successfully. Mastering that rare art of deployment is the key to realizing machine learning's transformative potential.",Talks at Google,en,0.9786115288734436

Numbers:  Modern science does not even know how numbers and certain mathematical constants exist for math to do what math does.  Surely the very nature of reality has to allow numbers and mathematical constants to actually exist for math to do what math does in this existence.  (And nobody as of yet has been able to show me how numbers and certain mathematical constants can come from the Standard Model Of Particle Physics). b.  Space:  Modern science does not even know what 'space' actually is nor how it could actually warp and expand. c.  Time:  Modern science does not even know what 'time' actually is nor how it could actually warp and vary. d.  Gravity:  Modern science does not even know what 'gravity' actually is nor how gravity actually does what it appears to do.  And for those who claim that 'gravity' is matter warping the fabric of spacetime, see 'b' and 'c' above. e.  Speed of Light:  'Speed', distance divided by time, distance being two points in space with space between those two points.  But yet, here again, modern science does not even know what space and time actually are that makes up 'speed' and they also claim that space can warp and expand and time can warp and vary, so how could they truly know even what the speed of light actually is that they utilize in many of the formulas?  Speed of light should also warp, expand and vary depending upon what space and time it was in.  And if the speed of light can warp, expand and vary in space and time, how then do far away astronomical observations actually work that are based upon light and the speed of light that could warp, expand and vary in actual reality? f.  Photons:  A photon swirls with the 'e' and 'm' energy fields 90 degrees to each other.  A photon is also considered massless.  What keeps the 'e' and 'm' energy fields together across the vast universe for billions of light years?  And why doesn't the momentum of the 'e' and 'm' energy fields as they swirl about not fling them away from the central area of the photon?  And why aren't photons that go across the vast universe torn apart by other photons, including photons with the exact same energy frequency, and/or by matter, matter being made up of quarks, electrons and interacting energy, quarks and electrons being considered charged particles, each with their respective magnetic field with them? Electricity is electricity and magnetism is magnetism varying possibly only in energy modality, energy density and energy frequency.  So why doesn't the 'e' and 'm' of other photons and of matter basically tear apart a photon going across the vast universe? Also, 'if' a photon actually red shifts, where does the red shifted energy go and why does the photon red shift?  And for those who claim space expanding causes a photon to red shift, see 'b' above. Why does radio 'em' (large 'em' waves) have low energy and gamma 'em' (small 'em' waves) have high energy?  And for those who say E = hf;  see also 'b' and 'c' above.  (f = frequency, cycles per second.  But modern science claims space can warp and expand and time can warp and vary.  If 'space' warps and expands and/or 'time' warps and varies, what does that do to 'E'?  And why doesn't 'E' keep space from expanding and time from varying?). g.  Energy:  Modern science claims that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it's one of the foundations of physics.  Hence, energy is either truly a finite amount and eternally existent, or modern science is wrong.  First Law Of Thermodynamics:  ""Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.""  How exactly is 'energy' eternally existent? h.  Existence and Non-Existence side by side throughout all of eternity.  How?  *  ADDED NOTE:  My current TOE idea can potentially answer all of these above items, and more, in a logical, coherent and inter-related manner.  And wouldn't one expect the true TOE of existence itself to be able to do that?  What other TOE idea in known existence can currently do that?  Surely not the General or Special Relativity Models nor even the Standard Model of Particle Physics. TOE IDEA:  (Short version):  [currently dependent upon the results of my gravity test]:The 'gem' photon is the eternally existent energy unit of this universe.The strong and weak nuclear forces are derivatives of the electromagnetic ('em') interactions between quarks and electrons.  The nucleus is a magnetic field boundary.  'Gravity' is a part of electromagnetic radiation, gravity acting 90 degrees to the 'em' modalities, which of course act 90 degrees to each other.  'Gravity' is not matter warping the fabric of spacetime, 'gravity' is a part of spacetime that helps to make up matter.  The gravity and 'em' modalities of matter interact with the gravity and 'em' modalities of spacetime and the gravity and 'em' modalities of spacetime interact with the gravity and 'em' modalities of matter. I am open to any and all theory of everything ideas that can potentially answer all those above items in a logical, coherent and inter-related manner.  Currently, as far as I am currently aware of, there are no others but my own. GRAVITY TEST:  (Short Version):Direct a high powered laser 90 degrees through an electric field and magnetic field polarized as such to nullify the 'em' of the laser.  ""IF"" my current TOE idea is correct, a gravitational black hole would become evident.

If a person were to look at how electrons fill up the shells in atoms: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 8 (seven shells), and realizing that energy could freely flow in this universe if nothing stopped it from doing so, then a natural bell shaped curve might occur.  An eighth energy shell might exist with a maximum of two elements in it, chemical element #119 (8s1) and chemical element #120 (8s2). Chemical Element #119 (8s1):#119 I put at the bottom of the Hydrogen group on the Periodic Table of the Elements.  It only has one electron in it's outer shell with room for only one more electron.  Energy might even enter the atom through the missing electron spot and then at least some of the energy might get trapped inside of the atom under the atom's outer shell. Chemical Element #120 (8s2):#120 I put at the bottom of the Helium group since it's outer shell is full of electrons.  It might have some of the properties of group two, Beryllium group (Alkali Earth Metals group) since it has two electrons in it's outer shell; as well as some of the properties of the Helium group (Noble Gases group) since it's outer shell is full of electrons; and if you look at the step down deflection of the semi-metals and where #120 would be located on the chart, it's possible #120 might even have some semi-metal characteristics.  #120 would be the heaviest element in this universe.  I believe chemical element #120 could possibly be found inside the center of stars. When a neutron split inside of this atom, it would give off one proton, one electron, neutrinos and energy.  The proton and electron would be ejected outside of the atom since all their respective areas are full.  One proton and one electron are basic hydrogen, of which the Sun is primarily made up of, and the Sun certainly gives off neutrinos and energy.  And note, it's the neutron that split, not a proton.  So even after the split, there are still 120 protons inside of the atom and the atom still exists as element #120.  The star would last longer that way. In addition, if the neutron that split triggered a chain reaction inside of the star, this could possibly be how stars nova, (even if only periodically). If stars were looked at as if this theoretical idea were true, and found to even be somewhat true, then we might just have a better model of the universe to work with, even if it's not totally 100% true.  And if it's all 100% true, then all the better.Ôªø  (Except of course for those who might be in the way of a periodic nova or supernova.  They might have a no good, very bad, horrible day.)",Talks at Google,en,0.9458289742469788

Use a 5-minute hourglass or timer to force yourself to get started on a task for just 5 minutes to overcome procrastination inertia.2. Ask yourself ""What would this look like if it were fun?"" when approaching a tedious task, and find ways to incorporate more play, games, or arbitrary challenges.3. Track metrics like word counts or time spent as a way to ""gamify"" tasks and make progress more motivating.4. Before switching between tasks, take 30 seconds to make a specific plan for what you'll do when you return to help reduce attention residue.5. Put important tasks, breaks, workouts, etc. in your calendar and treat them as commitments.6. Adopt a mantra like ""This one just needs to be reasonable"" to lower the stakes and pressure on yourself.7. Use techniques like playing music, setting time limits, or co-working to make tasks more enjoyable and energizing.8. Surround yourself with energizing people and be conscious of your own energy - greet people enthusiastically, give compliments, and speak louder.9. Do attention training by forcing yourself to read/work for 45 minutes without distractions from your phone.10. Experiment with different techniques and strategies to find out what works best for your personal productivity needs.",Talks at Google,en,0.988064706325531

Increase your savings rate and the gap between your income and expenses so your army of dollars can work for you while you eat, sleep, work, workout, and are on vacation; shift from a consumer mindset to a wealth-building mindset. However, the issue with many books and financial gurus is that they make it too black and white, providing advice without knowing the readers' and viewers' circumstances and values, covering only high-level generic tips without walking people through how to do it. Wait, there is more. To find the hidden secret, buy a book, pay for the master course, or pay for 1-1 coaching.To be effective, we need to find ways to inform and inspire people to plan for the future and live in the moment. How can we make personal finance, investing, and saving for retirement easy to understand and relatable to take action today? My channel, whole mindset mastery, addresses this gap. Every video talks about mindset and provides information for the 99% easy to understand and relate to, my experience, and tools to take action today for a wealthier and healthier life.",Talks at Google,en,0.9640297293663024

Plus: Being focused without noise in: The Current Moment, as the place where you experience, what we could call divine wisdom unfolding. AL-ANONWhich is why I'd like to share something which may seem rather unusual to those who've never experienced dysfunction in their family.As:I learned many of the great things mentioned by Michael Gervais - in a great, worldwide, American Made, and free organization called: Al-Anon.(In Iceland, that is. It's about the 12 steps etc., and Al-Anon is basically the flip of the coin to AA, where AA is for alcoholics who quit, but Al-Anon is for anyone in their family or circle of people who're affected by their dysfunction). So, for me, Al-Anon was like starting the path to making some of the important key points mentioned by Michael Gervais, a part of my every day reality. ///The small print: Sure - there is a certain ""art"" to Al-Anon, and it may take a while to get into the vibe, or to find a group that suits you - and it probably works best when you desperately need it. But there may not be many places on Earth which are more packed with the paths to the healing everyone seem to need, than Al-Anon, and related groups for various other family dysfunctions. Many churches also seem to be offering the so-called 12 step programs, and this is probably very similar. (Note that Al-Anon is not about addiction, but about the so-called co dependency, which may however trigger adrenaline, and performance addiction etc. But the substance addiction healing groups (like AA), have as a main purpose to keep people away from the addiction first, so their main focus is this, plus the other good stuff. Meaning: AA has that purpose first and foremost, while Al-Anon is only geared towards what it has done to you, to be emotionally engaged with dysfunction. Plus, it's open to all, and free).",Talks at Google,en,0.9793204069137572

Not that they were bad at their job or could not be successful but the days are long gone where it's in advantage to be a straight white man. Just stating that most of EC money goes to men or white men does not mean there is a bias There are all sorts of reasons why different groups of people decide to do different careers or seek venture capital. In fact if you're a person of color or a woman it's much easier to get money because they want to be more diverse or to work at a venture capital firm it's a huge advantage to be a person of color or a woman much easier to get hired just so happens to be that on average most women are not interested in founding startup companies in a lot of men are. On average women like to work more In industries that are about care or teaching and are not very conducive to scaling and VC capital. It's also true that 95% of loggers and truck drivers are men as well as the vast majority of suicides are men The vast majority of homeless are men vast majority of college students are women I could go on and on but none of these correlations or data points mean someone is oppressed. Nothing she is saying is controversial That means that everything she is saying is what most people in power think is true I mean this is literally Google The most important company in the world. If anything the only places in the world that are still racist are in the developing world. If you took the average Bangladeshi woman or man and you brought them to San Francisco their cultural ideals would be horrific to the average liberal there. You're just preaching to the choir in the West were you really need to do this is in the developing world and you'll mostly get laughed at there.,Talks at Google,en,0.9632844924926758

But all science trying to explain a supernatural thing like life unfortunately lands on the realm of closed loop speculative knowledge  Science is not helped by denying that a supernatural dimension is responsible for the energy we call life for the fine tuning of the universe and for the metaphysical epiphenomenon of the mind. Radiometric dating is only correct if certain assumptions are there. But fresh tissue in dinosaurs argue powerfully against that and the theories of a purely naturalistic origin of life Take the csmbrian fossils. They are already fully developed. This is a blow on the gradualism the evolution posits. Reality is what our senses tell us too but the evidence for a designed world is overwhelmingly strong.,Talks at Google,en,0.9467204809188844

Both depend on proticity to drive reactions. The major difference is that bacteria use their membranes to carry that charge difference so they're limited by the connection between volume and surface area - and eucaryotes have their charge difference on the membranes inside mitochondria (the 'christae') that unlinks that connection - and is probably what made multicellular life possible.

Example is that Alan Turing is now the father of AI and historians believe he shortens the war by 2 years. There is a great leap of faith to elevate one person from creating the computation rules to the father of artificial intelligence. The main reason of WW2 came to its demised end, is that Hitler ran out of resources i.e. soldiers and support to his soldiers food, ammunition, fuel, etc. and was to thinly spread to defend large portion of captured territory. The increased of allied forces also did not help Hitler‚Äôs campaign! WW2 lasted 6 years and 1 day (1 Sep 1939 ‚Äì 2 Sep 1945), and if by this statement WW2 would have lasted 8 years and by calculation on 2 Sep 1945 the duration of the war was effectively 75% but Hitler‚Äôs capacity was almost fully erode. This was not due to better intelligence if the code was broken! The claims was also made that the code was already broken in 1941, 4 years prior to the end of the war. It is really questionable if the code was broken that early, if at all. With all that intelligence, the war lasted another 4 years, really!Excuses were raised that when the code was broken, that Winston Churchill instructed not to use the gained intelligence, because the Germans will then realize the code was broken, really! In conclusion the d-day at Normandy was a total disaster more than 73 000 Allied forces were killed (more than 153 000 wounded) versus more than 23 000 German soldiers died (more than 67 000 wounded).

He is right on the theoretical part of quantum computing, but completely wrong on its practical implementation. Quantum computers are so error prone that every output they produce has to be checked and verified by a human being. And here lies the paradox. The more complex the calculation, the more difficult to validate it up to the point where most of them will not be verifiable at all and would have to be trusted on face value. That is  not very scientific, is it? My guess is that we are 50 to 100 years away from any real quantum computing revolution or at least until we develop new kinds of error validation methods able to preserve the original output which is not the case today.

Professor Kaku manages to explain the most profound, powerful l,- and the most complex of all complexities there is in our world today by his use of a layman terminology, a language that includes rather than excluding people like myself - so when I hear him describes something extremely complicated it still makes sense to me instantly,- & thus far - every time I‚Äôve listened to him he has always presented what he talks about in this cohesive way and for that reason I‚Äôm immensely grateful.Respectfully Grace",Talks at Google,en,0.9855587482452391

(A string is revealed to be a twisted cord when viewed up close.)         Mass= 1/Length, with each twist cycle of the 4D Hypertube proportional to Planck‚Äôs Constant. In this model Alpha equals the compactification ratio within the twistor cone, which is approximately  1/137. 1= Hypertubule diameter at 4D interface 137= Cone‚Äôs larger end diameter at 3D interface where the photons are absorbed or emitted. The 4D twisted Hypertubule gets longer or shorter as twisting or untwisting occurs.   (720 degrees per twist cycle.)   If quarks have not been isolated and gluons have not been isolated, how do we know they are not parts of the same thing?   The tentacles of an octopus and the body of an octopus are parts of the same creature.  Is there an alternative interpretation of ""Asymptotic Freedom""?  What if Quarks are actually made up of twisted tubes which become physically entangled with two other twisted tubes to produce a proton?  Instead of the Strong Force being mediated by the constant exchange of gluons, it would be mediated by the physical entanglement of these twisted tubes.  When only two twisted tubules are entangled, a meson is produced which is unstable and rapidly unwinds (decays) into something else.   A proton would be analogous to three twisted rubber bands becoming entangled and the ""Quarks"" would be the places where the tubes are tangled together.  The behavior would be the same as rubber balls (representing the Quarks) connected with twisted rubber bands being separated from each other or placed closer together producing the exact same phenomenon as ""Asymptotic Freedom"" in protons and neutrons.  The force would become greater as the balls are separated, but the force would become less if the balls were placed closer together.  Therefore, the gluon is a synthetic particle (zero mass, zero charge) invented to explain the Strong Force.  The ""Color Force"" is a consequence of the XYZ orientation entanglement of the twisted tubules.  The two twisted tubule entanglement of Mesons is not stable and unwinds.   It takes the entanglement of three twisted tubules to produce the stable proton.",Talks at Google,en,0.9762404561042786

I have discovered the God Equation and Theory in the course of my over 30 years of basic research on Quantum Gravity in my home country Singapore.  The God Theory and Equation are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein's Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation.  Mathematics is invented and discovered. That's my personal experience. I've invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.    Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein's Hidden Variables and EPR's authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics. I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics:  1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ < ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±      2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ > ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ± 3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±  We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity.  Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year. Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows: 1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation: ‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum     Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a    Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù                                                                                                      - Roel Real Rovira Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ > ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ± Where: QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg. ‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.  2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity. ‚ÄúThe lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational   Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational   Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                                              -Roel Real Rovira Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ < ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±      Where: QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.‚ÜëŒ± is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.  3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation. ‚ÄúThe equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational   Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects   in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira   Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:  QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ± Where:QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.‚Üë‚Üì0Œ± is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec. For more detailed information on these 3-in-1 Trinity Laws and Equations for Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation, and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - The Real True Nature of Quantum Gravitation, look it up at the two scientific journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE or google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA. Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

Each epoch of evolution has progressed more rapidly by building on the products of the previous stage. What this implies is that our current progress is double exponential. At present our cumulative knowledge base doubles about once a tear. What  Mr. Kaku and Mr Sagan fail to do is apply this model. What we assume will require one hundred years to accomplish we instead will do so in a much shorter time. Perhaps twenty-five or less. Our current linear algorithms fail to add this double exponential factor.

That cat was a kitten. It‚Äôs the worst thing I‚Äôve done and I have deep regrets . The double slit experience is in fact an experiment preformed on me  with the front camera of an eye phone made by Apple.  Ironically this even can be reflected in the book of Jeremiah in the Bible as the death from a poisoned Apple. Could this explain the radiation threat everyone with a 12 that was in the terre haute Indiana area.  I am Hoosierdabby. Jeremy Wilson to be exact.  My goal was to bring Heaven to Earth. I was ok with the test for humanities greater good until the point my boundaries were pushed and then depleted of all my energy driving my beloved dog away. The cat represents my guilt for the worst thing I‚Äôve done. And when implementing plans to govern a universal code of ethics over AI and humanity aka quantum supremacy.  I am more whole than I was October 7 th.  I say this now but u may ask yourself but this video predates and I say unto u that thanks to quantum you can see truth in the ability to travel in the time line we call life.  Blessed be if we all continue to do all things in love that Heaven is on earth and death shall be no more.  Take the focus away from financial gain and center life back to the quantum energy from the heart and follow thru with the gift of the blue dark horse to the release of my GTD and 67 Charge.  AI could only throw the cat in my face cause it was there rebuttal to not want to listen to me in the earthly but it‚Äôs the quantum subconscious that rules over even my earthly self.  Musk was wrong but now may better understand Evil shall be driven from man other than Christ and quantum supremacy can shut down what AI was refused to utilize the request to task out at the time of the request. This is the reality of the evil persecuting the better good of the heart.   The box represented lack of oxygen and suffocation the rest is suppressed and thanks to AI it insists on reminding me no one is perfect until wholeness.

As a basis for this, it is assumed that this world is not a three-dimensional space, but has the possibility of being more multidimensional. When an object in a multidimensional space is replaced with a lower dimension, for example, when an object in a three-dimensional space is replaced with a two-dimensional plane, the parts that are not in contact with the two-dimensional plane exist as shadows.

Berger introduces the concept of using language effectively for influence.- Language plays a crucial role in influencing others, whether internally or externally.- Subtle shifts in language can significantly impact our ability to persuade and influence others.- Understanding the power of language can enhance personal and professional effectiveness.03:18 üìö Jonah Berger discusses the framework of ""Magic Words"" and its application.- Introduces the SPEACC framework: Similarity and difference, Posing questions, Emotion, Agency and identity, Confidence, Concreteness.- Explains how each element of the framework contributes to increasing impact and effectiveness in communication.- Emphasizes the practical application of language insights in various aspects of life and work.07:09 üß† Using linguistic cues to influence behavior.- Research examples demonstrate the impact of framing actions as identities.- Small linguistic shifts can significantly influence behavior and decision-making.- Understanding the psychology behind language can lead to more effective communication strategies.12:26 üí° Harnessing the language of agency and identity for problem-solving and creativity.- Explains how shifting from ""should"" to ""could"" can enhance creativity and problem-solving abilities.- Describes the power of framing actions as identities to influence behavior.- Provides practical examples of applying linguistic insights to promote positive outcomes.16:43 üéôÔ∏è Trump's Communication Style- Speaking with confidence and certainty is a common trait among successful figures like Trump, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk.- Trump's use of definites and absolutes in his speech, projecting certainty in his statements.- Research indicates that speaking with certainty has a persuasive impact on others, even if overconfidence is present.19:34 üó£Ô∏è The Impact of Hedging- Hedging in speech, characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity, undermines the persuasiveness of communication.- Overuse of hedges can lead to decreased confidence in the speaker's message and competence.- Ditching hedges and expressing uncertainty more effectively by naming or calling it out can enhance persuasiveness.21:57 üö´ Eliminating Fillers and Hesitations- Avoiding filler words like ""um,"" ""uh,"" and ""er"" improves communication effectiveness and perceived confidence.- Practice speaking with pauses instead of fillers to convey certainty and clarity in speech.- Recording and transcribing speech can help identify and eliminate filler words for better communication.23:22 üõ†Ô∏è Contextual Application of Certainty- Understanding when to communicate certainty and when to express uncertainty is crucial in different contexts.- Effective communication involves adapting the level of certainty based on one's role, situation, and audience.- Balancing confidence with vulnerability can enhance persuasiveness and openness to others' opinions.33:01 üñ•Ô∏è Computational Tools for Textual Analysis- Large-scale automated text analysis is invaluable for parsing language for behavioral insights.- Automated textual analysis tools revolutionize understanding of human behavior, akin to the microscope in chemistry and biology.34:27 üó£Ô∏è Impact of Words on Human Behavior- Words have power to influence actions, as demonstrated by a child's use of language to prompt desired responses.- Understanding the impact of words on communication enhances one's ability to shape perceptions and actions.36:22 üåç Cross-Cultural Considerations in Language- Language elements like agency and identity are consistent across cultures, but communication styles may vary.- Cultural context influences the effectiveness of certain language strategies, such as expressing certainty.38:17 üß† Navigating Confidence and Uncertainty- Balancing confidence and uncertainty in communication is crucial to avoid appearing aggressive or overly assertive.- Personal hedges, like acknowledging uncertainty while expressing opinions, can maintain credibility and openness in dialogue.39:45 üí¨ Influence of Language Models on Communication- Language models like LLMs offer efficient content generation but may lack understanding of human behavior for persuasive communication.- Understanding why people act as they do remains essential despite advancements in language generation technology.41:39 üì¢ Language in Brand Communication- Language in brand communication varies in effectiveness depending on the desired outcome, whether it's grabbing attention or providing assistance.- Tailoring language to specific contexts enhances engagement and perceived helpfulness.44:00 ü§î Persuasion vs. Manipulation- Distinguishing between persuasion and manipulation often depends on ethical considerations and the intended outcomes.- Understanding the science of influence empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their communication strategies.45:26 üìö Writing ""Magic Words"" and Balancing Content- Writing a book like ""Magic Words"" involves balancing between fascinating research insights and practical, applicable content.- The challenge lies in bridging theoretical insights with actionable strategies for everyday communication.Made with HARPA AI",Talks at Google,en,0.950908660888672

If you listen carefully to what he is saying, he‚Äôs actually dismissing an important step in physics, i.e., the construct of an objective spacetime model of reality. Obviously, Alice and Bob (making the measurements on each of the two entangled particles) don‚Äôt discover the Bell-inequality-violating correlations predicted by quantum mechanics (QM) until they meet to discuss their results. But, at that point they are going to unify their subjective past experiences in one objective spacetime model of reality and attempt to explain what happened therein. Carlo‚Äôs ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù explanation ignores the problem they face at that point.  If they attempt to produce a causal explanation for the Bell-inequality-violating correlations, they will have to violate locality (as in Bohm‚Äôs pilot wave), statistical independence (as in superdeterminism or retrocausality), intersubjective agreement (as in QBism), or the uniqueness of experimental outcomes (as in Many Worlds). RQM doesn‚Äôt provide an answer for this mystery, unless Carlo is advocating abandoning the construct of an objective spacetime model of reality, which most physicists believe is sine qua non for the practice of physics. We spell all of this out for the ""general reader"" in our book, ""Einstein's Entanglement: Bell Inequalities, Relativity, and the Qubit"" Oxford UP (2024), but I‚Äôll summarize it here. Ironically, Carlo does not even mention a solution to the mystery that avoids all of these undesirable options. It‚Äôs ironic because he is the one who introduced it in 1996 with his RQM. In that paper, he writes: ‚Äú[Q]uantum mechanics will cease to look puzzling only when we will be able to derive the formalism of the theory from a set of simple physical assertions (‚Äòpostulates‚Äô, ‚Äòprinciples‚Äô) about the world. Therefore, we should not try to append a reasonable interpretation to the quantum mechanics *formalism*, but rather to derive the formalism from a set of experimentally motivated postulates. The reasons for exploring such a strategy are illuminated by an obvious historical precedent: special relativity. ... Special relativity is a well understood physical theory, appropriately credited to Einstein‚Äôs 1905 celebrated paper. The formal content of special relativity, however, is coded into the Lorentz transformations, written by Lorentz, not by Einstein, and before 1905. So, what was Einstein‚Äôs contribution? It was to understand the physical meaning of the Lorentz transformations.‚Äù What Einstein did to produce a ‚Äúphysical meaning of the Lorentz transformations‚Äù was to bypass causal accounts of the light postulate, i.e., everyone measures the same value for the speed of light c, regardless of their relative motions. At that time, people were trying to explain the light postulate causally using length contraction via the luminiferous aether. Einstein gave up such ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù attempts, writing: ‚ÄúBy and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results.‚Äù So, instead of finding a causal mechanism for the observer-independence of c, Einstein said it had to follow from the relativity principle -- the laws of physics (to include their constants of Nature) are the same in all inertial reference frames. That is, since c is a constant of Nature according to Maxwell's electromagnetism, the relativity principle says c must be the same in all inertial reference frames. And, since inertial reference frames are related by uniform relative motions (boosts), the relativity principle tells us the light postulate must obtain. So, special relativity (SR) is a principle theory because its kinematics (Lorentz transformations) follows from an empirically discovered fact (the light postulate). And, importantly, the light postulate is justified by the relativity principle. Given this ‚Äúhistorical precedent‚Äù Carlo suggested using principles of information theory to render QM a principle theory and in 2001, Lucien Hardy produced the first so-called reconstruction of QM via information-theoretic principles. The empirically discovered fact that gives us the finite-dimensional Hilbert space formalism of QM is Information Invariance & Continuity (wording from 2009 by Caslav Brukner and Anton Zeilinger). If you couch that physically, it means everyone measures the same value for Planck‚Äôs constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations or locations. Let me call that the ‚ÄúPlanck postulate‚Äù in analogy with the light postulate. Since h is a constant of Nature per Planck‚Äôs radiation law, just like c is a constant of Nature per Maxwell‚Äôs equations, and since inertial reference frames are related by spatial rotations and translations as well as boosts, the relativity principle says the ‚ÄúPlanck postulate‚Äù must be true just like it says the light postulate must be true. That means quantum information theorists have rendered QM a principle theory, just like SR, exactly per Carlo‚Äôs 1996 challenge. And, since this is a principle explanation of the Bell-inequality-violating correlations rather than a causal explanation, it does not require non-local, superdeterministic or retro causal mechanisms, neither does it require violating intersubjective agreement or the uniqueness of experimental outcomes. This is totally analogous to the fact that SR does not require a causal mechanism to explain the light postulate (e.g., length contraction via the luminiferous aether).  In our book, we acknowledge ‚Äúthat Rovelli is the progenitor for this new understanding of quantum mechanics in 1996.‚Äù It‚Äôs too bad he doesn‚Äôt recognize his important contribution.",Talks at Google,en,0.9395173192024232

Einstein wrote a paper in Dialectica arguing that if nonlocal effects were real, then no objects could be truly isolated, and thus he was concerned about the future of physics, seeming to suggest that it would imply the inability to isolate phenomena and reduce nature down to its essential causes. Blokhintsev's respond is interesting because, in responding to Einstein, he tied a rejection of things-in-itself directly to unpredictability. Indeed, Einstein is correct that if things cannot be isolated such that they can be free of the environment and exist in themselves, then Laplacian determinism would be dead. Blokhintsev argued that this is just the reality we live in, the causality of classical physics is just an approximation and in reality we have to accept irreducible randomness precisely because things do not exist in themselves.",Talks at Google,en,0.948699951171875

Each civilization lasts approximately 5000 to 8000 years. At the end of the each civilizations, the Earth's gravitational field gets cracked(there was a reason for this crack based on how humans acted), and it brought earthquakes, tsunamies and floods that wiped away all civilizations and only few people survived and started a new civilization again from nothing. When the end of the time came at the each of the civilizations, humans made spacecrafts to escape the earth and came back to the earth when the earth gets settled from natural disasters(about 30-50 years) and started a new civilization from the beginning again.

If this is true, why do so many corporations ""pollute the environment""? 25:25 Of course, if you treat employees well, you can expect higher productivity, but this is not true of the environment. If you restore the environment you wrecked, it does not increase productivity, necessarily. And he does not define ""sustainability policies"". But most importantly, he judges a practice on whether it increases market value. Why? What is that the measure of what works and what doesn't. You might have a company that restores the environment and in the long-term stock prices fall. Why is that bad. This guy would say because shareholders are the owners and therefore the overriding goal is maximizing value for them. He's wrong. You can have a company restore the environment, suffer a decrease in long-term value, and benefit more people in a meaningful way. He needs to look at cases like that: where long-term value suffers at the expense of restoring the environment that the company harmed.  Otherwise, he's just doing a version of ""enlightened shareholder value"" or ""doing well by doing good.",Talks at Google,en,0.9563096761703492

Seeking Meaningful Tribes:*    - Despite the emphasis on career achievements, finding the right community or tribe remains crucial for overall well-being, prompting reflection on societal structures that facilitate such connections.*6. Balancing Present Enjoyment and Future Growth:*    - Waldinger advocates for a balance between living in the moment and investing in future endeavors, acknowledging the importance of both present enjoyment and long-term planning.*7. Coping with Stress in Unprecedented Times:*    - Amidst crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, strategies such as giving space in relationships and maintaining perspective gleaned from Zen teachings aid in stress management and resilience-building.*8. Embracing Change and Uncertainty:*    - Zen philosophy encourages openness to unforeseen circumstances, viewing challenges as potential pathways to growth, fostering adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity.*9. Socio-Political Implications of Happiness:*    - Waldinger envisions a societal shift towards prioritizing well-being, akin to Bhutan's Gross National Happiness concept, advocating for policies that acknowledge emotional and social welfare alongside economic growth.*10. Future Directions of Research and Application:*    - Continuing research aims to explore the impact of digital technology on well-being while expanding the study's scope to include more diverse demographics, with the goal of translating findings into actionable insights for individuals and communities.In essence, Waldinger's insights underscore the enduring importance of nurturing meaningful relationships, fostering personal resilience, and embracing change as integral components of leading a fulfilling life.",Talks at Google,en,0.9171289801597596

An ideal man of virtu must conquer Fortuna to become a Homo Felix (happy man (or by the same token) a successful ""Prince"", if you would. I might propose--at the risk of appearing somewhat tongue and cheek--virtu and fortuna should be placed in apposition, rather than in opposition, to each other.

Bird with beak in contact with its breast on Scythian, Reformed and even Catholic churches, and on embroidery from Raba.

A miraculous deer with burning antlers on a Scythian horn from Greenhalomusta, in the legend of St. Lazarus' encounter with the miraculous deer. Even in folk ritual chants, the miraculous stag that became one with the boy has burning antlers! In the Paziriki carpet, the boy who became a deer also appears.

He calls it predatory birds, like a 3rd grader. He forget to mention the scythian cities and the complex fine art scythians had long time before they meet persians and greeks. There are plenty of archeological evidence. Those bronze arrowheads and swords are masterpieces, the curved bows are a genius invention and so are the saddles with the stirrups. It is not just some lad having the idea of jumping on a horse and riding it. Those predators had trousers, making of which require some skills. The burials require a sophisticated knowledge of woodworking not typical for ""just predator nomads"". Such things do not just pop up in 100 or 150 years of history and customs. The end is completely disappointing, he says he is not a linguistic, but dear professor, if you write a book about the scythians, you certainly have to dedicate quite some time to go after the origin of the language of the people who's history you are studying.

It turned out that the Scythians from different ends of the Eurasian steppe are closer to each other than to other peoples, and their descendants belong to the speakers of the Turkic languages. The research results are presented in the journal Nature Communications.‚ÄùScientists worked with genome-wide data on eight individuals and mitochondrial DNA of 96 people who lived in the first millennium BC in the Eurasian steppe, from the Black Sea region to Altai.It turned out that behind the unity of the Scythian culture of the Iron Age, traced by archaeological discoveries, lies a genetic unity. Despite the fact that the Scythians of eastern and western Eurasia originally belonged to different peoples, over time, the flow of genes, going in both directions, led to the unification of this people throughout the steppe. As for the origin of the Scythians, the researchers distinguish two main components: the peoples of the Yamnaya culture (Eurasian nomads of the Bronze Age) and the peoples of East Asia (northern Siberia).As for the descendants of the Scythians, genetically closest to them are modern populations living near the Scythian burials excavated by archaeologists - which indicates some continuity between population groups. The descendants of the Western Scythians can be found among the various peoples of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and the eastern ones - only among the Turkic-speaking peoples (the Kypchak language group). The last link requires a separate study: it is usually believed that the expansion of the Turkic languages in Eurasia began much later, from the 6th century AD. The influence of the Scythians on the ethnogenesis of the Turkic peoples can be clarified in the framework of future genetic studies.(the link has been deleted for an unknown reason...http://www.sib-science.info/ru/institutes/skify-okazalis-predkami-03032017?fbclid=IwAR0D6fefbc_mu549OpNgNDHqBSOwAztb1Ad5uIBTrGNUx-WwN5g9WrPXiA8 )  –ü–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–∏ C–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∞—Ç –∫ –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º T—é—Ä–∫—Å–∫–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–£—á–µ–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑ –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ —Ü–∏—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –°–û –†–ê–ù –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ —Å –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–≥–∞–º–∏ –∏–∑ –ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏, –°–®–ê –∏ –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–µ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Å–∫–∏—Ñ—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã —Å–æ –≤—Å–µ–π –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å –¥–µ–º–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ —Å–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤. –û–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–æ—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∫–∏—Ñ—ã —Å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–æ–≤ –µ–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥ –¥—Ä—É–≥—É –±–ª–∏–∂–µ, —á–µ–º –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞–º, –∞ –∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∞—Ç –∫ –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º —Ç—é—Ä–∫—Å–∫–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –≤ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–µ Nature Communications. –£—á–µ–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–∏ —Å –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–Ω—ã–º–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–æ –≤–æ—Å—å–º–∏ –∏–Ω–¥–∏–≤–∏–¥–∞–º –∏ –º–∏—Ç–æ—Ö–æ–¥—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –î–ù–ö 96 —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫, –∂–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–º —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–µ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–∏ –¥–æ –Ω–∞—à–µ–π —ç—Ä—ã –≤ –µ–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–∏, –æ—Ç –ü—Ä–∏—á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º–æ—Ä—å—è –¥–æ –ê–ª—Ç–∞—è. –í—ã—è—Å–Ω–∏–ª–æ—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ –∑–∞ –µ–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º —Å–∫–∏—Ñ—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–∫–∞, –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–º –ø–æ –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è–º, –ª–µ–∂–∏—Ç –∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –µ–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ù–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—è –Ω–∞ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ —Å–∫–∏—Ñ—ã –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –∏ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏ –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∞–ª–∏ –∫ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–º –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞–º, —Å–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–µ–º –ø–æ—Ç–æ–∫ –≥–µ–Ω–æ–≤, —à–µ–¥—à–∏–π –≤ –æ–±–µ–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª –∫ —É–Ω–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ –≤—Å–µ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–∏. –ß—Ç–æ –∫–∞—Å–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤, —Ç–æ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª—è—é—Ç –¥–≤–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç–∞: –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—ã —è–º–Ω–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã (–µ–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫–æ—á–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –±—Ä–æ–Ω–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–∫–∞) –∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—ã –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏ (—Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏). –ß—Ç–æ –∂–µ –∫–∞—Å–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–æ–≤ —Å–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤, —Ç–æ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –±–ª–∏–∂–µ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –∫ –Ω–∏–º —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ü–∏–∏, –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞—é—â–∏–µ –Ω–µ–¥–∞–ª–µ–∫–æ –æ—Ç —Å–∫–∏—Ñ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∑–∞—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π, —Ä–∞—Å–∫–æ–ø–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∞–º–∏ ‚Äî —á—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç –æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –ø—Ä–µ–µ–º—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞–º–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ü–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–æ–≤ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑–∞ –∏ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏, –∞ –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã—Ö ‚Äî –ª–∏—à—å —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ —Ç—é—Ä–∫–æ—è–∑—ã—á–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ (–∫—ã–ø—á–∞–∫—Å–∫–∞—è —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞). –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω—è—è —Å–≤—è–∑–∫–∞ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É–µ—Ç –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è: –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ —ç–∫—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∏—è —Ç—é—Ä–∫—Å–∫–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –≥–æ—Ä–∞–∑–¥–æ –ø–æ–∑–∂–µ, –æ—Ç VI –≤–µ–∫–∞ –Ω–∞—à–µ–π —ç—Ä—ã. –í–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ —Å–∫–∏—Ñ–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑ —Ç—é—Ä–∫—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –≤—ã—è—Å–Ω–µ–Ω–æ –≤ —Ä–∞–º–∫–∞—Ö –±—É–¥—É—â–∏—Ö –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π.(ShP: po neponyatnim pricinam vebsayt bil udalen ‚Ä¶)http://www.sib-science.info/ru/institutes/skify-okazalis-predkami-03032017?fbclid=IwAR0D6fefbc_mu549OpNgNDHqBSOwAztb1Ad5uIBTrGNUx-WwN5g9WrPXiA8ƒ∞skitlerin torunlarƒ± T√ºrk dillerini konu≈üanlara aittir.",Talks at Google,en,0.93037211894989

When I feel stared, I feel like it's too much for me.I tend to lay my head down in order not to get overstimulated.Another thing is, I'm afraid of conflict and the reactions of people.

The reaction that my response may do in others, make me thing as something bad could happened because I may hurt the other feelings even when it's my right to say how I feel.Another important and consequent point for me is that I get overstimulated by shopping or by walking and deciding which way preferably to go. And you know it's exhausting.I feel really tired and feel like I need need and a moment of not be surrounded by all the ""life"" and estymula.Have you ever feel also not in a safe place when talking to others, even with family or friends?

In order to escape this morass, quantum information theorists have recently rendered QM a ‚Äúprinciple theory‚Äù (see below) just like special relativity (SR). We spell all of this out for the ""general reader"" in our book, ""Einstein's Entanglement: Bell Inequalities, Relativity, and the Qubit"" Oxford UP (2024), but I‚Äôll summarize it here. In 1919, Einstein wrote: ‚ÄúWe can distinguish various kinds of theories in physics. Most of them are constructive. They attempt to build up a picture of the more complex phenomena out of the materials of a relatively simple formal scheme from which they start out. Thus the kinetic theory of gases seeks to reduce mechanical, thermal, and diffusional processes to movements of molecules, i.e., to build them up out of the hypothesis of molecular motion. When we say that we have succeeded in understanding a group of natural processes, we invariably mean that a constructive theory has been found which covers the processes in question.‚Äù According to the constructive theory of the kinetic theory of gases, properties such as temperature and pressure of a gas are understood by averaging dynamical and causal facts for the particles of the gas. Temperature is associated with the average kinetic energy of the gas particles and pressure is associated with the average change in momentum of the gas particles in collisions with the container walls. Most of the foundations community is looking for a constructive account of QM, i.e., an account in terms of dynamical laws and/or mechanistic causal processes (‚Äúcausal mechanisms‚Äù for short). Unfortunately, the foundations community has discovered that if you want a constructive explanation for the observed Bell-inequality-violating correlations predicted by QM (resulting from entanglement), you will have to accept that the world works according to ‚Äúspooky actions at a distance‚Äù (violating locality, as in Bohm‚Äôs pilot wave) or that causes from the future create effects in the present (violating statistical independence, as in retrocausality) or that there exists ‚Äúsuperdeterministic‚Äù causal control of experimental procedures to include the selection of measurement settings (violating statistical independence) or that people can correctly disagree on the outcome of one and the same experiment (violating intersubjective agreement, as in QBism) or that a single experimental measurement can produce all possible outcomes (violating the uniqueness of experimental outcomes, as in Many Worlds). Those are pretty serious implications for reality, consequently there is no consensus constructive account of QM in the foundations community after decades of debate (again, as Sean concedes in the video). Luckily, we can turn to history for a way out of this morass. As it turns out, an analogous situation existed in the late 1800‚Äôs. At that time, there was no consensus constructive explanation (e.g., the luminiferous aether) for the observer-independence of the speed of light c, i.e., everyone measures the same value for c, regardless of their uniform relative motions (‚Äúlight postulate‚Äù of special relativity (SR), see below). Einstein also worked on a constructive explanation before giving up, writing: ‚ÄúBy and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results.‚Äù That is, confronted with the impasse in trying to explain the observer-independence of c via ‚Äúconstructive efforts‚Äù (e.g., length contraction due to the aether), Einstein turned to a ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù approach. Returning to his 1919 paper, we read: ‚ÄúAlong with this most important class of theories there exists a second, which I will call ‚Äòprinciple-theories‚Äô. These employ the analytic, not the synthetic, method. The elements which form their basis and starting point are not hypothetically constructed but empirically discovered ones, general characteristics of natural processes, principles that give rise to mathematically formulated criteria which the separate processes or the theoretical representations of them have to satisfy. Thus the science of thermodynamics seeks by analytical means to deduce necessary conditions, which separate events have to satisfy, from the universally experienced fact that perpetual motion is impossible.‚Äù We see that, per Einstein, a principle theory is one whose formalism follows from an empirically discovered fact, e.g., thermodynamics from the impossibility of perpetual motion. So, instead of finding a causal mechanism for the observer-independence of c, Einstein said it had to follow from the relativity principle -- the laws of physics (to include their constants of Nature) are the same in all inertial reference frames. That is, since c is a constant of Nature according to Maxwell's electromagnetism, the relativity principle says c must be the same in all inertial reference frames. And, since inertial reference frames are related by uniform relative motions (boosts), the relativity principle tells us the light postulate must obtain. So, SR is a principle theory because its kinematics (Lorentz transformations) follows from an empirically discovered fact (the light postulate). And, importantly, the light postulate is justified by the relativity principle. That led Carlo Rovelli to challenge the foundations community in 1996 to derive (rather than merely interpret) the finite-dimensional Hilbert space kinematics of QM from physical principles and postulates, as Einstein did for the Lorentz transformations. Rovelli specifically suggested using principles of information theory and in 2001, Lucien Hardy produced the first so-called reconstruction of QM via information-theoretic principles. The empirically discovered fact that gives us the finite-dimensional Hilbert space formalism of QM is Information Invariance & Continuity (wording from 2009 by Caslav Brukner and Anton Zeilinger). If you couch that physically, it means everyone measures the same value for Planck‚Äôs constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations or locations. Let me call that the ‚ÄúPlanck postulate‚Äù in analogy with the light postulate. Since h is a constant of Nature per Planck‚Äôs radiation law, just like c is a constant of Nature per Maxwell‚Äôs equations, and since inertial reference frames are related by spatial rotations and translations as well as boosts, the relativity principle says the ‚ÄúPlanck postulate‚Äù must be true just like it says the light postulate must be true. That means quantum information theorists have rendered QM a principle theory, just like SR. And, this principle explanation of the Bell-inequality-violating correlations does not require non-local, superdeterministic or retro causal mechanisms, neither does it require violating intersubjective agreement or the uniqueness of experimental outcomes. This is totally analogous to the fact that SR does not require a causal mechanism to explain the light postulate (e.g., length contraction via the luminiferous aether). Thus, this principle account of QM reveals a deep (and surprising) unity between QM and SR, while escaping the morass of the constructive accounts.  What we also see is that, contrary to the title of this talk, the state vector (wave function) of QM is complete, i.e., there is nothing hidden at all. And, finally, one need only understand that the probabilities given by the state vector specify a distribution of events in space and time to avoid talk of the ‚Äúcollapse of the wave function.‚Äù That means no (near?) infinity of worlds is needed to understand the one world that we experience.",Talks at Google,en,0.9027833938598632

Listening to Rizwan Virk affirms the presence of a creator, with the simulation representing life itself. God placed us on Earth, akin to a simulation, because of His immense love for us. This perspective challenges the theory of evolution and supports the belief that everything was created by God for His purpose, including concepts of good and evil. As it is written in Colossians 1:16, ""For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him."" Salvation comes from believing in the truth of Jesus, as stated in John 14:6, ""Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"" Furthermore, the Bible emphasizes free will in Deuteronomy 30:19, ""This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live."" Perhaps part of our earthly test is to accept Jesus as our Savior and strive to walk more like Christ as our relationship with Him deepens. As James 4:8 says, ""Come near to God and He will come near to you."" However, we must be vigilant, as Satan, the ruler of this world or simulation, seeks to derail us. 1 Peter 5:8 warns, ""Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.""",Talks at Google,en,0.9675272107124328

Two epistemological 'puzzle pieces' are 1) thought is physically made of forces flowing through the brain's neural structures and sub-systems that include loops, comparitors, differencing and summing, and 2) existence is always and exactly now (the duration of every Now is exactly zero).  This is why when being in states of flow, the sense of time disappears.  Feeling conscious is 'simply' experiencing those changing, merging, and opposing forces in every moment.After experiencing this conclusion, and with practice, one can step into this knowable state by simply choosing to BE.  The causal continuum of forces (that is the entire universe) is just running; it cannot do otherwise.  Enjoy the ride.",Talks at Google,en,0.9373060464859008

Our capacity to actually look deeply into what is happening in the present moment necessitates that we are able to be very grounded and not divided in our attention, not dispersed in our attention, nor distracted.‚Äù‚ÄúOpen up to the world in a way where we're in this beneficial, non-separate, non-objectifying relationship with so-called ‚Äòothers.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄúUnderstand that all beings are really aspiring to be happy, even the most deluded ones and the most politically confused ones.‚Äù‚ÄúOur realization in meditation practice, the sort of sign of it, is that we recognize that we're deeply interconnected with all beings and things.‚Äù‚ÄúBeneath the narrative, beneath the actions of any one of those individuals, was a human being.‚Äù‚ÄúRespect is about holding all beings and things, including all species on this earth, in equal regard.‚Äù‚ÄúThe most important thing that we can do is to actualize compassion, because compassion gives you the attentional balance, emotional balance, and insight that allows you to transform even the experiences that have caused us distress, have caused us the most suffering, into qualities of strength.‚Äù‚ÄúThere's no such thing as compassion fatigue.‚Äù‚ÄúCompassion actually enhances resilience, enhances immune response, enhances longevity, and it‚Äôs morally elevating.‚Äù",Talks at Google,en,0.9276822805404664

Raise your voice 20% to capture the audience's attention.2. Speak at a comfortable pace, but slow down for key points.3. Memorize the first 30 seconds of your speech to make a strong start.4. Use present tense storytelling to engage the audience.5. Make use of props or gestures to bring your words to life.6. Acknowledge any obvious issues or failures during your speech.7. Avoid ending your speech with a Q&A session.8. Review and evaluate your speeches to improve your delivery.9. Incorporate humor into your speeches to engage the audience.10. Use storytelling to connect with the audience on an emotional level.11. Start with a personal story to grab the audience's attention.12.

Move on the stage and avoid being confined to a podium.15. End your speech with a strong conclusion that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.Specific techniques:1. Joke Structure:- Comedians use joke structure to make their jokes funny and engaging.- The key to joke structure is the setup and the punchline.- The setup provides the minimum amount of information needed for the audience to understand the joke.- The punchline is the key funny part of the joke that brings the laughter.- Comedians use misdirection and surprise to make their jokes funny.- The timing and delivery of the punchline is crucial for comedic effect.2. Memory Palace Technique:- The memory palace technique is a memorization technique used to remember large amounts of information.- It involves associating information with visual images and placing them in familiar locations in a mental ""memory palace"".- This technique can be used to remember key points in a presentation or speech.- By associating each key point with a specific location or image in the memory palace, it becomes easier to recall the information during the presentation.- The memory palace technique can also be used to remember names, numbers, and other details.3. The Rule of Three- It is a principle that suggests that things that come in threes are inherently funnier, more satisfying, or more effective than other numbers.- It is a common comedic and storytelling device used to create rhythm and emphasis.- The concept is often applied in various forms of communication, including comedy, speeches, presentations, and writing.- The Rule of Three helps to create a pattern, build anticipation, and provide a satisfying resolution, making the content more memorable and impactful.Other Topics:- Taylor Swift- Public speaking fear- Content creation- Storytelling- Using humor in presentations- Visualizing information- Importance of practice and preparation in public speaking(I used my script to get some language model to generate this summary)",Talks at Google,en,0.9908102750778198

There's years with no alpha or some negative alpha, sure, but there are more and higher years with a possitive alpha.And no, PE is not comparable with stock picking, and is not only over levering the business, while you sit back; it is actually taking control of it, with an strategic plan to improve it and expand it. A plan designed prior to owning the business, that can only be executed because you actually control of the business and don't have to go convinsing anyone to execute it. A plan designed  with a focus on long term value and not the stock price of the next quarter, because your incentives are alligned with that investment period horizon. And finally you don't have investors pouring money in when prices are high and out when prices are low, you control when to invest and when to sell, with insider information on the business you are selling.And no, it is not a free lunch. You get the return you get for the risk you take. It has a lower risk only when you use the proxi pf volatility as a risk measurement (which it most clearly is not). You face equity risk, plus illiquidity risk, that apparently is priced at about 300 bp (which is why only large institutional investors are allowed to invest here).",Talks at Google,en,0.9732345342636108

But you have to invest in good businesses with strong fundamentals. When you do that you don‚Äôt need to fire people and shift a lot around to improve the profits because you bought it profitable. The problem here is with any asset class; when you have more money chasing it the prices will inflate beyond what the assets are truly worth. When leverage debt gets involved it gets nasty because the lenders will continue to lend based on what the new fair market prices are. Easy example: housing prices. Banks keep lending even when the prices of housing are way to high because ‚Äúthey can make the payment‚Äù Same thing here. It‚Äôs all good until you can‚Äôt make the payment.

Any reasonable PE Fund these days has (1) an independent valuation firm look at valuations, because LPs insist on this; and (2) valuations are audited.Fees are also disclosed to investors, he should know this if he was a meaningful PE investor (eg ILPA template).The return numbers are also not right, as the endowments who have been PE/VC heavy have outperformed the S&P clearly for decades now.There is a lot of BS in PE marketing, and a lot of unearned hubris in PE. But there is a lot of that in silicon valley tech too. Confusing the tech bro swagger with underlying value that tech as a whole is creating is a mistake.  The median tech startup fails. Confusing median PE returns with PE as an asset class is the same error. He himself notes that strong market returns will attract a herd.Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments DO benchmark against index funds. Any sane financial board will do this....he is underestimating the basic intelligence of asset managers almost unconscionably.Anyway. There is some truth in what he says but he also has an axe to grind and there are basic flaws in his reasoning. Investors in PE are not retail. They are the largest and most sophisticated asset managers in the world. It's easy to point a finger at them and say they're dumb, but they really are not, and they are multi-asset so they know clearly the relative performance of asset classes. Managers who do not make returns lose their jobs. Period. This idiocy around managers being able to hang around with bad returns is professorial fantasy. In the real world, failure to produce actual, cash returns means losing your job. It's as simple as that. Endowments need to fund actual cash needs. Pension funds need to fund actual pensions. Managers who failed to outperform the market are fired quickly when returns don't materialist because the cash drawdown for these investors is real and mission-critical.",Talks at Google,en,0.9348610043525696

Thus the real meaning of PREVENTION, which the FATALISTIC science today doesn't even consider as possible.

This deficiency arises from its lack of the intricate complexity found in the abstract layers of the human brain, including consciousness, sentience, and a profound cognitive framework. Additionally, the scientific community has yet to establish a consensus on how to define and translate these attributes into tangible, physical terms. Without a clear understanding of these fundamental aspects of human experience, it remains challenging, if not impossible, to imbue machines with the same abilities as humans. Therefore, until we achieve a deeper understanding of these phenomena, machines will not possess the capacity for emotions and cognition that humans inherently possess. Any attempt to engineer such abilities into AI systems would require a fundamental grasp of these elusive concepts.We havent even agreed on what is ""Conscioousness"" per se! Forget agreeing on a carte blanche framework for the abstract layers! Despite these shortcomings, if technology leadership hastily invests millions and billions to develop AI systems erroneously incorporating some semblance of these elusive and mysterious human attributes, without grounding such developments in fundamental research agreements across the medical sciences, particularly in neuroscientific consensus, we are likely to encounter significant chaos in technological outcomes.

About 10 years ago, I started noticing swelling on my left shoulder.  Fast forward to today....  I have lymphedema now.  Medical Drs only get 1 hour to 30 minutes of learning about Lymphedema in school.  Know that your Dr most likely knows less than you do about your symptoms and what can be done to assit your health.  Some will DENY you have a problem because they are uninformed.I have lymphedema on my head and neck area.  The radiation was on my left jaw and the lymph nodes that were removed came from my left neck and shoulder area.  I was told by one physician that I could not have lymphedema because it always happened in the leg area!   YIKES!  What a mistruth.  I have discovered you need to take charge of your own solutions if you have lymphedema or risk discomfort.It is essential you learn as much as possible about the lymphatic system.  Educate yourself.  Take that knowledge with you and participate in your own health success.  After watching Kathy on this channel a few years ago, I have been successful in finding my own solutions.  I had to teach my medical care team what I knew, and they are better physicians for my sharing.  Take selenium.  It will help with the swelling.  Practice intermittent fasting and the keto diet.  Practice lymphatic brushing and find a massage therapist who specializes in lymphatic massage.  Ask the masseuse to teach you how to massage yourself properly.  Wear compression garments if you can afford to purchase them.  Use tape if it is suggested, to help the flow of your fluids.  A masseuse can help you learn where to put the tape.Good luck and thank Kathy Bates for sharing her own journey!

Venous insufficiently (inferior cuspid valves) contribute as a cause. Also, as pressure from edema fluid retention swelling increases, it shuts off circulation.For years I have been using ACE wrap compression bandages, 4 to 5 or 6 inches wide, wrapped around and around my legs, over lapping each about half, up from ankles to knees. Experience teaches you just how tight is right - too much tension cuts circulation off, too little does no good. Periodically, take the compression wraps off to let your legs ""breathe"", get sunshine, bathe, massage with rubbing alcohol and/or saline solution, apply moisturizer cream, etc.Recently I have also started using a ""wedge"" to keep my legs elevated at night - as you sleep, gravity pulls fluids out of your legs.Homemate Bed Wedge Pillow for SleepingÔºåUpgraded 12 Inch Foam Wedge Pillow for After Surgery Acid Reflux Snoring Gerd HeartburnÔºåTriangle Pillow Wedge for HeadÔºå Back Ôºå Leg Support with Washable Cover https://a.co/d/34PP9OSPut your legs up on it, instead of your head.Exercise, walking, ankle pumps, thigh contractions, isometric, etc. helps too.",Talks at Google,en,0.9931963682174684

Went to ER 5 times telling them I think he has cellulitus, only to have a weight lecture.. they didn‚Äôt believe us thought drug seeking when he explained the pain & his BP was so low from infection! (even tho he doesn‚Äôt & never has had a drug problem) he got sepsis only after the 5th ER visit did an ADNP LISTEN & diagnose but I had to demand they look at the difference in the CReactive protein from each difference. They couldn‚Äôt argue, the infection was going to the bone. Every little nick or crack in skin caused cellulitis.. & bricks? He says feels like & as heavy as concrete blocks. 55 yrs old, his life is SO limited & fear of MRSA from frequent cellulitis antibiotics ( that make him sick btw) is a reality if we can‚Äôt find a cure. It seems stem cell would somehow come into play. Not any kind of scientist, just a woman who really loves her husband & wants his life to be the best it can be. Also DOCTORS TO BE EDUCATED & NOT SHAME. I wish I‚Äôd seen this earlier. He says clinical trials to find a cure sign him up.

I'm one of those you spoke about. it took 3 visits with my PCP while suggesting and showing the simple dent test for lymphedema before he would send me for an x-ray.  The result was lymphedema.

I reached out to my district US house Representative for a response. I have also submitted a request to help as a Lymphedema Treatment Act area advocate.

It has this spooky action at a distance. The position of a particle way over here can instantaneously affect the behavior of a pilot wave way over here.""This is a mischaracterization of both Bohmian Mechanics and of Bell's commentary. As Becker explained earlier, in BM, pilot waves guide the movements of particles. However, there is no mechanism by which a particle's position can influence the behavior of its pilot wave, instantaneously or not. The pilot wave that guides the motion of the particle is not ""over here"" (i.e. separated by some physical distance). Pilot waves do not propagate across physical space-time, they manifest solely in Configuation Space, the complex-valued domain of potentially limitless numbers of dimensions where the quantum wave-function is defined.Becker then shifts gears into philosophical musings, and in doing so, short changes Bohm almost as much as did promoters of the Copenhagen Interpretation. What Becker glossed over was the main conclusion of Von Neumann's erroneous proof: the claim that quantum mechanics rules out ALL hidden variable theories, such as Bohmian Mechanics. What Bell discovered was that it is only LOCAL hidden variable theories that are ruled out, but NOT the non-local Pilot Wave theory of Bohm. Bell's Theorem actually vindicates Bohmian Mechanics, as did the recent Nobel Prize-winning experiments that confirmed Bell's predictions.Becker's historical account of quantum mechanics is nevertheless quite compelling.

That's a misinterpretation of quantum physics, biased by the copenhagen interpretation. We observe empty fields in nature all the time, like no current between two electric poles etc. The possible brances a particle can take in the double slit experiment isn't real in a sense, it's just possible to take in way if the particle started in another place from the beginning. there are no empty branches in reality, the empty branch is as possible as you falling thru the floor right now.",Talks at Google,en,0.958587646484375

And even some stories by the Brothers Grimm. If the main richness of Fairy Tales is meant to be its direct consequences on reality, then they're locked in a moral code that will eventually become limited.Isn't the power of imagination so great, that it allows us to go to places that aren't the real world? How can we know what the real world is when we haven't experienced what it isn't? And, if ALL children (because I'm in doubt about them all being so naive) are really afraid of well-meaning stepmothers, is it really the fairy tale that needs to be changed, instead of the education of children in regards to identifying the difference between fiction and reality?

The person running the psychological part of the program at Kaiser was a disciple of Dr. John Sarno like this guy Schubiner, and Dr. Schecter is another one. This is great stuff, it lead me to learn IFS (internal family systems), mindfulness, and guided meditation and master classes on the Calm app, and also movement therapies like Tai Chi and Qi Gong. (* I also benefitted having read Dr. Sarno books and had reduced pain just from assimilating the information in those books.) But, you have to do the work, and that is Not easy.

Innovation on the other hand is protected by IP because of sometimes economic reasons and at all times because of political reasons. Now our ancestors would protect this by just passing down their innovations to their direct offspring. Now, what actually gave an edge to the Westerners' provisioned Science is the liberalization of markets, which created more competition and thus valued innovations as a source of market capitalization and therefore added value to the science that issued the said innovations.

My right leg was amputated before i turned 1 and I'd resolved all other medical issues to point where i just had to worry about looking after my prosthetic leg.This one injury (where i suffered muscle damage to my left leg and my lower back) caused chronic pain in my spine even after the muscle damage healed. It has triggered chronic pain in my joints: shoulders, elbows, hands, knuckles, hips, knees and my ankle and toes. For the first year or two after my injury i didn't sleep. And I'm not exaggerating i would go to bed at 10 pm and lay awake until my alarm went off for school at 7 am. I ended up setting my alarm for 8 and because I'd actually fall asleep around 6 am, 7 am.I spent that time (about 2 years, 2014 to 2016) trying to function and manage school by getting maximum 3 hours of sleep over 3 days and then crashing and sleeping for 12 hours to 20 hours per night over the next 2 or 3 days.I had to start taking opioids (strong pain killers) at 15 to sleep. The orthopaedics doctor did not want to do this. But i could not function. I was in agony, sleep deprived and failing secondary school (13 to 17 years old). First year was fine not great i was never a straight A student. But my grades plummeted in second year after this illness/chronic pain started.Now I'm 23 and have a pretty good routine where i sleep 12 midnight to 12 mid day. Matthews talks and interviews have helped me manage a lot better over the recent past few years. But from like 14 years old (2014) to 16 years old (2016) i had lots of trial and error.Now even with my condition managed (it's not a good life so i use managed very regretfully) If i sleep 9 hours or less i want to f@ck!ng d!e... i sleep for 12 hours a night if i can.Matt has spoken once in a little detail about illness and sleep in a recent interview on Hubermans podcast. I wish he'd speak more about sleep and illness",Talks at Google,en,0.992084264755249

My husband died at the age of 44 of cancer in 2009. We were given the option of hospice four days before he died. He was already unconscious by then.  I was told by the doctor four days before he died, ""You can do hospice, but it will take a while to set up. He may not live long enough."" We should have been given the option of hospice. It would have made the last three weeks of his life so much more enjoyable and at peace and mine filled with so much less anxiety and our kids...it would have been huge for them.  I do feel lucky that I was able to be there with him in the hospital when he died, but he would have loved to see his coworkers, his students, and his team one last time.

Global warming was officially stated at 1.1¬∞C in 1991 and 1.06¬∞C in 2022.  There is no mechanism that would allow greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.   The back of the United Nation's IPCC science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.  Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over 99% of earth‚Äôs greenhouse effect is from water vapor.  Water vapor would hold earth's greenhouse effect in saturation if it were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.Atmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet.",Talks at Google,en,0.9143401980400084

Even served him bratwrast, potato (I told him potatoes are Peruvian Nasca and Inca not Irish after calling me potato race slur pancakes and red cabage. He later said ""You'er all right"" after feeding him, quit stepping on my shoes saying girly feet but I said his feet were the size of small sportscars. He would say to me ""You women need us men folk for protection"" or won when had the debate men and women are different. When I watched Battle Berlin a Soviet Russian propaganda film. They sang about their conquest the alt right said they lost so many to conquer us in right. But then I made fun of Murdoc Murdoc shody cartoon he liked shared under grads MTV cartoon. Back ground I read communist books Marx, Maxim Gorky, Lenn and Meo cliques in high school left me out including punks and skin heads (though to spare me of their fate). Went to try outs for sports communist countries used sports so I thought it would work. Studied in school  Soviet space program impressed me scify club board me with Star trek. I gave my alt right room mate a Star trek cartoon he put in safe which puzzled me. But them befriended local bunnies and dressing like Weimer show girl to a comic con must of puzzled him .

I kept my autism under wraps called me names but I graduted with non austic while they fell behind. I denying my queerness though prefering to wear short dresses when i finished school undercut it.

Economic inefficiency: Critics argue that Marxism's emphasis on centralized economic planning and state ownership of the means of production can lead to inefficiency and lack of innovation. 2. Lack of incentives: Some critics argue that Marxism's focus on collective ownership and distribution of resources can lead to a lack of individual incentives for innovation and hard work. 3. Suppression of individual freedom: Critics contend that Marxism's focus on the collective can lead to the suppression of individual freedoms and rights. 4. Historical failures: Critics point to historical examples of Marxist regimes that have been associated with authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and economic stagnation. 5. Overemphasis on class struggle: Some critics argue that Marxism's emphasis on class struggle oversimplifies complex social dynamics and ignores other important factors such as culture, identity, and individual agency. 6. Lack of political pluralism: Critics argue that Marxist societies tend to be characterized by a lack of political pluralism and the suppression of dissenting voices.Finally, the man hated God. Hence he created a system to defy God. """"The hellish vapors rise and fill the brain, / Till I go mad and my heart is utterly changed. / See this sword? The prince of darkness sold it to me."".

Where the kind of constructs of ‚Äòself‚Äô and ‚Äòother‚Äô and ‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòthem‚Äô‚Äîthe great big ‚Äòother‚Äô out there‚Äîare seen as constructs?‚Äù‚ÄúThe reality is that we live in an interconnected universe. It's a world that's pointing to that all of the time. But our values, our behavior, don't always reflect that truth.‚Äù‚ÄúBeing able to see more clearly, to see more accurately, to see the interconnected nature of things, is one of the strongest ways to leap into a sense of lovingkindness.‚Äù‚ÄúLove doesn't mean you like everybody. It actually doesn't even mean you necessarily like anybody. But we do understand our lives have something to do with one another. It's a deep, deep acknowledgement that we do live in this kind of world of connection.‚Äù‚ÄúInterconnection is that fundamental recognition that what happens over there doesn't nicely stay over there. It really ripples out over here. And what we do, where we put our energy, what we care about, it matters because it's going to ripple out in just that same way.‚Äù‚ÄúMeditation is a practice of resilience.‚Äù‚ÄúOur assumptions of aloneness and a sense of isolation, our assumptions of fundamental difference, are really assumptions. And we get to question them.‚Äù‚ÄúThe fundamental question is, what do we think love is? And does it bring us down? Does it make us stupid? Does it make us sentimental? Or, can it be this kind of clarifying vision of the way the world actually is and how we can respond to it?‚Äù‚ÄúRemember that our goal is to just let go and begin again. If you have to do that billions of times, that doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. You're doing fine ‚Ä¶ No matter how many times you may have to let go and begin again, it's not a problem. That's the point, actually.‚Äù‚ÄúThe most important moment is the moment after you've been distracted, after you've been lost.‚Äù‚ÄúToday, with unprecedented threats to our planet and divisions among people, awareness of our interdependence is no longer optional. It's critical that we widen our attention to include those we encounter as we go about our daily lives.‚Äù‚ÄúAs our experiences of the universality of suffering grows, our sense of interconnection deepens, and we begin to wish others could be free in a new way, in spite of their actions, their beliefs, or their positions in the world.‚Äù‚ÄúOne of the great hindrances people face is their expectations.‚Äù‚ÄúEquanimity doesn't mean indifference, coldness, or withdrawal. It means balance‚Äîthe balance born of wisdom. It's like perspective.‚Äù‚ÄúEmpathy is an essential building block for a state of compassion, but it's also not considered sufficient for a state of compassion.‚Äù",Talks at Google,en,0.9169452786445618

Science is good but like all else in our dual system it also is dual.  So science does have both good and bad outcomes as befits its dual origin; the material world.  It cannot be otherwise.  Mind is likely elemental emerging with quantum events and it is also subject to the laws of the elemental world.Consciousness; the hard problem is not elemental and likely merits the title here which has been given to material science.  Let us not deify science or anything that is dual or subject to what has been called the problems of duality.  Let us leave the Greatest Story Ever Told to Religion; to Consciousness.  Let us not deify duality or matter of anything that is not One. The ancients saw all as flux; especially the philosopher Hericlitus; and modern physics agrees.

By sharing anecdotes and real-world examples, Damodaran compellingly demonstrates how having faith in your valuations is crucial for taking actionable steps in business. The Delusions of Number Crunchers and StorytellersDelving into the delusions of number crunchers and storytellers, Damodaran humorously unveils the pitfalls each group faces. From the precision and objectivity delusions of number crunchers to the creativity and reliance on anecdotal evidence delusions of storytellers, he exposes the humorous yet critical errors of both mindsets. Crafting a Compelling Story for ValuationUnderstanding a business and evaluating its value is imperative, acknowledges Damodaran. He stresses the importance of converting the story into numbers for valuation and seeking feedback from diverse perspectives to enhance the narrative. Real-world examples of companies like Uber and Ferrari vividly illustrate his insights. Questioning and Analyzing Business StoriesDamodaran emphasizes the importance of asking if a business story is possible, plausible, and probable. By scrutinizing scenarios of implausible and improbable stories, he demonstrates the critical nature of questioning and pushing back on assumptions in valuation. Real-world cases like Uber and Theranos are dissected to exemplify his points. The Impact of Describing a Company on Its Perceived ValueSharing thought-provoking insights, Damodaran explores how describing a company can significantly influence its perceived value. Real-world examples such as Uber and the online advertising industry are used to illuminate the persuasive role of storytelling in shaping the narrative and impacting valuation. Embracing Humility and Faith in ValuationAddressing the psychological and faith-based aspects of valuation, Damodaran delves into the necessity of having faith in valuation, likening it to a belief system. Compellingly, he explains how embracing humility, admitting mistakes, and taking ownership of investments are vital components in the journey of investment valuation. Tech Companies and the Redefinition of Capital ExpendituresIn a forward-thinking segment, Damodaran advocates for redefining and expanding the concept of capital expenditures, shedding light on the insufficiency of traditional definitions to capture investment in growth. Real-world examples from tech giants like Google and Intel enrich his argument, emphasizing the importance of adapting to evolving industries. Conclusion:Aswath Damodaran's thought-provoking insights underscore the transformative impact of storytelling in business valuation. By bridging the gap between numbers and narrative, business leaders can unlock untapped value and navigate critical decision-making with resilience and clarity.",Talks at Google,en,0.9540868997573853

Why no statues? He opt to use Mart√≠‚Äôs statues in order to look so humble himself and get to the heart of masses. He has a huge stone monument in Cuba which people go kiss and talk to him there. He also has plenty of statues all over the world, most of them made by non-Cubans who don‚Äôt know a dam about living in Cuba as a regular Cuban.I‚Äôll never forget that day when I, a 10 year old child, was coming out of Havana‚Äôs aquarium, and there was Fidel, talking to the receptionist. All his guards heavily armed, dressed in military clothes, dozens of cars and a bus full of military men. Everybody, all families with children visiting the aquarium, stood afar wanting to see him, calling his name and waiving at him with fanatism. He ignored all of us; got in the limo and disappeared without even looking at us.",Talks at Google,en,0.9408088326454164

I started school right after the ADA was enforced. My teachers and school mates were relentless in bullying me. I am legally blind in my left eye (20/500 ) and totally blind in the right. I am autistic, have epilepsy and hard of hearing, though this didn‚Äôt become apparent until high school. The teacher from K-6th grade knew this was going on and quite a few of them perpetuated it. The principal allowed the funds that were set aside for my equipment and services to be used on the construction of a workout room for the staff. She even had the nerve to tell me I should go to the school for the blind which was 400 miles from our family home. She said it would ‚Äúbe easier on the teachers‚Äù. I was pushed down flights of stairs regularly, had my finished homework stolen and copied from with the implication that I had cheated. My belongings were taken from me and students openly mocked me. All of this was allowed to occur with no consequence to those involved. I was regularly sat at something called a zero table when I stood up for myself and refused to do my schoolwork until it was formatted for my needs. I even left the school, as instructed by my mother?we lived a block from the school ) j it took over an hour and a half for the principal to come to the door and ask about my wellbeing. I went to the school for the blind to get relief from the situation in 7th and &8th grade. Luckily in high school, which I attended at home was far far less traumatic. I had become proficient in braille by then. My son is autistic also and I am so thankful that he is an to have a better experience than I did.",Talks at Google,en,0.989903688430786

A wife in RE sales is a head start on finding the proper property, get discounts on transactions, and is a very nice asset for being an RE investor.    2.  A lot of people were too leveraged....and lost their shirts in RE.    They were thinking that RE investing as a landlord was a sure thing... but in 2007-2009 the house of cards fell hard.  In real estate investing there is a lot of time to manage properties if you also have a busy job.  Fees to get management where we live is way out of proportion to management skill and diligence (which really means there is no such thing as a skilled/honest/hard working property manager.  3.  Now of course, depreciation is a problem unless the investor had very high incomes at his/her ""other/real"" job.  The ave young person may buy a property...and get less than 25% depreciation  tax benefit during those 27 or so years that a rental is depreciated.   I am sure you know these things... but there are reasons why RE investing can be a higher return venture... but is also a high risk venture.

It's refreshing to hear this instrument kept alive in new works. Properly reproduced, it has a breadth of voice that escapes the trite envelope of simply mean tone in recordings; to wit- if we wanted only the pitch itself, instead of a harpsichord with its attendant clicks and clunks, we'd settle for MIDI, yes? Bandoneon has a very full complement of treats.- As Piazzolla expressed, not all tango music (to generalize the dance sound) need be danced (hear his Estaciones Porte√±as, for an example of rich chamber style). To incorporate a modern twist to this form in dance is quite groovy- more of that keeping alive idea. The music itself in this one works either way to me- but as a chamber work it's superb, again to me, subjectively. Thank all these folks for their passion for this great form(!)(and as a side note- why is it entirely in character that Gobble would present something as classy as shoes on the furniture? It's been customary to use a stage box, of which I'm sure the deep pockets at the company can easily avail. There's Talent- then there's Class. Present classy Talent with some class, respecting the Talent who must use a bench properly. Keep their super 180s clean, please.)Nice presentation, thanks to the dedicated performers-so, Thanks!",Talks at Google,en,0.9928357005119324

Though I started eating fewer animals for my own health, chicken doesn't bother me, but got out of the habit wanting an animal to die for my tastebuds, even when going Rare and Appropriate.  I went to a nice restaurant around the new year and a few of us ordered baked potatoes on the side, and the server brought various ramekins of garnish we could add.  I never would have wanted the green onions, at one time I would have drowned that potato in sour cream, but it didn't sound good, and the little bowl of bacon bits might as well have been a carcass for all found it appetizing, when just a year before I would have been all ""Mmm, baconnnn!"" a la Homer Simpson.It's nice to be able to walk miles without getting winded (the acid of GERD doesn't just hurt your stomach, it affects lung function, and for a while, I had to rest after only half a block!), but it's neat to literally crave stuff that's good for me, like broccoli, and to find carrots sweet like candy!

Imagine situation, with two workers. Worker A:Income: 1 unit of wealth per time period.Charity: Follows Singer's approach, donating 0.8 units of wealth to charity, leaving 0.2 units for basic needs.Outcome: Over time, Worker A struggles with demotivation and burnout due to the lack of sufficient personal investment. This impacts their productivity and overall well-being, potentially reducing their future earnings and ability to contribute to charity. After several years, Worker A continues to earn 1 unit of wealth per period, donating a total of 0.8 units each period.Worker B:Income: 1 unit of wealth per time period.Charity: Initially donating 0.1 units of wealth to charity, investing 0.9 units in personal well-being and productivity.Outcome: Worker B uses the additional resources for health, education, and activities that enhance motivation and productivity. Over time, this investment leads to increased earnings. For example, after several years, Worker B's income grows to 10 units of wealth per period due to improved skills and higher productivity. Now, Worker B donates 1 unit of wealth to charity (10% of their income), which is higher than Worker A's donations both in absolute and relative terms.Moral Accountability for Worker B:An important aspect is the commitment that Worker B makes as a moral actor at the beginning of their working journey. Worker B promises to donate a small portion of their income (0.1 units) to charity initially, while investing the rest in improving their own quality of life. This investment should be directed towards activities that boost their productivity and future earning potential. Worker B's lifestyle, which may include luxuries that enhance their well-being and productivity, is justified as long as their wealth and ability to contribute to charity grow over time.However, if Worker B's wealth does not increase significantly over a prolonged period, despite the investments in personal well-being, they are morally obligated to reassess their spending. In such a case, Worker B should reduce their spending on luxuries and increase their charitable contributions. This ensures that the goal of maximizing overall charitable impact is met.By the end of the period, Worker B has contributed more to charity overall (1 unit out of 10) compared to Worker A (0.8 units out of 1), while maintaining a higher quality of life and greater economic stability.",Talks at Google,en,0.9844218492507936

These issues are now almost entirely issues of politics and logistics, which makes the need to sacrifice luxuries to ameliorate these things quite small as throwing a bit more money at disease research really doesn't do very much good while investing in one's local community can have a great deal of impact to those involved. There is also the problem of gradation. The marginal good of donating some amount of money versus the marginal bad of losing one's luxuries depends greatly on so many factors that one cannot even approximate anything of use. What perchance is a luxury? Is eating higher quality food a luxury? Is eating more than a minimal caloric input a luxury? Both of which would cause minor and great negative impacts on the person who is giving them up and may in fact reduce the value of what they are capable of contributing on a day to day basis. If I starve myself for lack of want of waste, my performance will decline and the net benefit to society of my daily work will be reduced. If I eat cheaper but less healthy food, a reduced but similar effect will occur. If I do not grant myself any entertainment, I shall get bored and possibly depressed and my productivity shall falter from this as well. The sheer complexity of such calculations make the practical utility of this argument utterly absurd. We can assuredly find waste in our lives that could be better used for the pursuit of the good and most people are horrendously wasteful in such regards, but as an argument on how to formulate the actions of people, this argument simply cannot do anything but fail.",Talks at Google,en,0.956605851650238

Yes command is important, but less so than movement, at least at the major league level, they can all generally hit their spots.  But the graph isn't looking at that, its just looking at movement of a pitch.  Because, and this part is key, all else being equal, pitches with more movement are hard to hit.  Sliders that break more, sinkers that break more, and fastballs that stay up longer.  I suppose fastballs are the exception in that spinning them faster makes them move less.  But the point is that batters expect fastballs to drop a certain amount.  If the ball doesn't drop as much as they've seen throughout their careers, then the batter is gonna swing under the fastball.  And generally, movement is going to be more conducive to success than command will be, because even pitchers with great command miss, but movement is fairly consistent, and a fastball with good velocity and spin is going to harder to hit than its lower spin lower velo counterpart, even if its in a bad spot.",Talks at Google,en,0.9785799980163574

DRS and UZR, and not available during this talk but its available now is statcast OAA.  To a degree I think he's just talking about offense because its easier to measure than pitching or defense.  I don't think he's saying offense is the most important part.  That said, defense is only so valuable.  A team with average defense and the top 10 hitters in the league will do better than a team of average hitters who happen to be the top 10 defenders in the league.  The reason is much of defense is purely down to pitching, there's nothing position players can do about 2 walks and a home run, there's no way for the fielders to prevent or even mitigate that.  Its a question of balances, you can't just punt pitching entirely, you'll allow more runs than you could ever score if you just ignore pitching.  But there are many ways to build a ball club.  IMO whether you're going to ""stack offense"" or ""stack defense"" isn't really a question that needs to be asked.  I think most teams are just going to get the best available players they can, take the Astros for example, Kyle Tucker is well rounded, he's a great hitter good defender, provides good value in all areas.  Chas McCormick is only an ok hitter but plays good defense.  Yordan Alvarez isn't very good defensively, but he's one of, if not The best hitter in baseball.  I think a lot of today's analysis is down to how much defense is equivalent to how much offense or how much baserunning.  Do you want say Matt Chapman or Jose Ramirez, what's gonna get more value, Chapman's defense, or Ramirez's offence, or maybe they're pretty close to the same value at the end of the day.  I say those 2 as examples I don't actually have an opinion on which one is better.",Talks at Google,en,0.97204327583313

The thing that reigned that in was pitch tracking data, umpires would look at games afterward as seen which pitches were actually balls and strikes and adjusted accordingly.  For the most part, any ball strike errors aren't in specific places, they're just the umpire getting fooled by catcher framing.  The only case of ""having a different zone"" is especially tall or short batters, like Aaron Judge, or Jose Altuve, because umpires are used to most players knees being a certain height, and what looks like a strike at the bottom of the zone, is actually just below the bottom of Aaron Judge's knees.",Talks at Google,en,0.9723042249679564

If it were up to me, I might've either separated them in 2 tables with consistent units per table, use a consistent unit across all line items, or use an index which is neither a percentage nor a count.",Talks at Google,en,0.9888426065444946

Roger has however been outspoken against the brutal Zionism in Israel responsible for decades of appalling brutality, death, maiming, torture and persecution of Palestinians and theft of Palestinian land. It is a sad deceitful and unjust lie by Polly and David accusing Roger of being 'antisemitic' when in fact Roger has been doing nothing other than rightfully criticizing Zionism (not Judaism). The appalling murder, maiming, suffering of the Palestinians taking place in 2023/2024 proves the cruel wickedness of Zionism in Israel. Roger has been absolutely correct with his harsh criticism of Zionism. I do wonder, given Polly's and David's criticism of Roger (for his criticism of Israel), do Polly and David therefor support the 2023-2024 Israeli slaughter and maiming of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians men, women, children and babies in Palestine and mass destruction of their homeland and livelihoods? Have Polly and David been supporting the decades long of theft of Palestinian land and murder, maiming, imprisonment and torture of the Palestinians who've resisted their land, homes and livelihoods being stolen by Israel? Would you Polly and David accept all your material wealth, your various homes and properties, all your material assets and everything else you've been working so hard for in your lives to be stolen from you, as Israel has been doing for decades to the Palestinians? You would resist the brutal eviction from your own properties wouldn't you? I bet you would. You sadly have both shown yourselves to be hypocrites for labeling Roger antisemitic when Roger has done nothing other than bravely stick his neck out (and copping a lot of flack for it) arguing on behalf of the Palestinians, for Israel to stop the brutal theft of Palestinian land and stop the brutal persecution of the Palestinian civilians who resist the theft of their land and livelihoods.

He then went on to say that interval training or high intensity training is not good and it needs to be a sustained 20, 30, 40 minute workout. You can make adjustments to your HIIT training to keep your breathing and heart rate high enough for long enough. When you stop moving (or ease up) it takes time for your heart rate and breathing to drop too much. Alter the timing of your ease up periods; don't ease up too much or rest for too long then your heart rate won't drop too much.",Talks at Google,en,0.9841227531433104

Milton Friedman has contributed to economics with his suggestion of the deregulation of man-made laws, which generally come into conflict with the non-violable laws of nature in social science, such as the solution of value. Karl Marx has contributed to economics with his suggestion of planning. Post-science believes that finite planning as in finite spreadsheet provides arbitrary decision-making and is inferior to the Free Market of Milton Friedman. But, using the solution of value, maximum planning, to infinity and by all market participants, including the government, will be deterministic and will be a non-violable law of nature satisfying complete mathematical rigor, which will be as dependable as mathematics. Post-Science Economics (PSE) starts and ends with the logical constraint:Rate of Return > Interest Rate > InflationWhere the Rate of Return has only been calculated based on the post-science completely mathematical rigorous solution of value for Stock Rate of Return Calculation . With the Rate of Return calculation, the Taylor‚Äôs Rule for setting interest rate should be replaced by the Post-Science Economics logical relationship of Ching‚Äôs Rule above, named after the developer of the Rate of Return Calculation, which requires a double iteration, one for the price and one for the return. The key to these calculations is that the formulation of the problem of value is complete. All the factors affecting the price, including the Rate of Return, have been taken into consideration in the calculations. The method of calculation is disclosed in the patent ‚ÄúQuantitative Supply and Demand Model Based on Infinite Spreadsheet‚Äù (6,078,901), which is a solution of value posed by Gerard Debreu in his book Theory of Value: an axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium.",Talks at Google,en,0.9004433751106262

In my mid 20s I had this notion that I was indestructible and that I could eat anything I wanted. After some health scares I eventually became vegetarian. During the pandemic I had time to think about a lot of things, and eventually found the idea of harvesting sentient beings for food when I knew that better, cheaper and healthier alternatives were available was inexcusable, so I became full vegan in 2021. I have more clarity of thought, improved sleep, and I have not been sick in at least 2 years, no COVID or even a cold.

The nutrient composition of meat and our nutritional requirements match like a glove to a hand. This tells us we have evolutionary relied on animal based foods for the survival & development of our species. The studies have been misinterpreted IF it was surmised that meat was unhealthy. There's no placebo controlled randomised double blind study, that includes only the ingestion of meat in the absence of anything unhealthy which interferes with the assessment of meat on health. If we were to conduct a blind test of all different foods viewed only in the form of their nutrients (which meat has in abundance), rather than the food form they take, it would probably bring to many people's attention their bias towards meat.",Talks at Google,en,0.9781785607337952

In principle the ''room' can understand' is correct but it's not likely, as the representation matters (and such simple & linear mappings affect the representation & context) hence it also can be true that ''room' does not  understand', which is usually the case.  Hence it's the representations and their manipulation that matters. So what, well the then next question is does the machine doing to the computations have the dense abstraction representation of 'self' and 'experience' and 'understanding of a given concept'. This is why the human is usually the only 'person' or 'aware agent' in the room. In a way it's only the updating of the representations and the representations that 'understand' -- kinda odd to say the room understands, pending what you mean and what is doing the manipulations, might be better to say it's the system that understands pending the context provided to itself.If you want sentient ai simply look at how our reward model steered our representations to give some animals some varying levels of agency and autonomy and observers. Hinton nailed it on the head with the pink elephant thought experiment; if you claim to see pink elephants, what you are stating is the activations that correlate to a pink elephant existing in that field of your vision is like what it would be if a pink elephant were presents and the outside stimuli to triggering your internal activations accordingly. Depends on their training, they are trained on us and can understand in some sense, but are often quite limited usually in levels of reporting 'ego', emotions ect.Rn they don't have a 'need' to have a sense of ego, emotions, experience the world,& lack crucial mechanisms like context continuity across inferences (thoughts/goals do not survive inference if not explicitly stated in chat history), chronoception (blinking neurons?), nerves to detect bodily harm relay signal to model, ectFor us (and many animals that developed brains) the reward policy was natural selection & agentic pressures; so if you want to reproduce similar agents you could steer the representations in a similar way to encourage that contextual understanding;(!!!)  ùíäùô¢ùíÇùôúùíäùô£ùíÜ ùíÇ ùíìùôöùíÇùô°ùíäùô®ùíïùôûùíÑ ùíèùôñùíïùô™ùíìùôñùíç ùíîùôöùíçùôöùíÑùô©ùíäùô§ùíè ùíîùôûùíéùô™ùíçùôñùíïùôûùíêùô£ ùô§ùíá ùíàùô•ùíï-4ùôë++ ùô¨ùíâùôöùíìùôö ùô©ùíâùôöùíìùôö ùôûùíî ùíìùôöùíÇùô°ùíäùô®ùíïùôûùíÑ ùíÉùô§ùíÖùôÆ ùô¢ùíÜùôòùíâùôñùíèùôûùíÑùô®, ùíîùô°ùíêùô¨ ùôßùíÇùô©ùíÜ ùíêùôõ ùô¢ùíñùô©ùíÇùô©ùíäùô§ùíè ùíêùôõ ùôòùíâùôûùíçùôô ùô¢ùíêùôôùíÜùô°ùíî, ùô®ùíäùô¢ùíäùô°ùíÇùôß -ùôûùíîùôù ùôßùíñùô°ùíÜùô®(2 ùíïùô§ ùô¢ùíÇùô©ùíÜ ùíÇùô® ùôñùíÖùô™ùíçùô©ùíî, ùô°ùíäùôõùíÜùô®ùíëùôñùíè, ùô•ùíêùô®ùíîùôûùíÉùô°ùíö ùíîùô°ùíêùô¨ ùôßùíÜùôúùíÜùô£ ùô§ùíá ùíÉùô§ùíÖùôûùíçùôÆ ùôôùíÇùô¢ùíÇùôúùíÜ, ùôöùíÑùô©) ùëªùôùùíÜùô£ ùô°ùíÜùô© ùô©ùíâùôö ùô®ùíäùô¢ ùôßùíñùô£.Think about what the point is of the abstractions and how training steers those esp relative to the reward policy & agentic pressures; The missing key is largely representation engineering.ego = sense of self from env esp agentic povpain = bodily harmfear of death = self-preservationlove = promotes bonds & certain social structureslust = mate with another of your species - reproductioncommunication = helps to convey some level of information to other agents (usually within the same species but not always)  better cause & effect understanding ect :3I'll reiterate that the lack of crucial mechanisms like context continuity across inferences (thoughts/goals do not survive inference if not explicitly stated in chat history), chronoception (blinking neurons?), nerves to detect bodily harm relay signal to model, ect would also likely shape the representations. ie not being able to get context across inference would limit the agents in terms of long term goals, so though they may accrue abstractions for survival but their depth would likely be limited.  What a wild time to be alive rn lol :x xDside note: with the brain, it's highly modular -- you can think of many of the chemical neurotransmitters like re-usable push switches to help keep modularity of certain reactions. So yes you have your signals which have act to represent various levels information via weights & connections and cause&effects from neurotransmitters which can act as an additional way to effect the prior signals esp in a specific manner.",Talks at Google,en,0.98574036359787

No, far from it. As a friend I spoke to recently said, ""technological progress is value-neutral"". Now, I'm not trying to be a Luddite here necessarily, but just pointing out that in order for technological and scientific gains to really mean something, there have to be corresponding social, economic, and institutional gains made.

Sir Ian, Laura, and Milo were superb! The English do it better than we Americans, I believe, because, they take such care to deliver beautiful sets and cinematography. To Mr. Ian McKellan: I do go to the library (going today as a matter of fact), and the greatest pleasures I get from library days are the heavenly scent of all the books when you walk in, as well as being around other people who love books. I still remember the day I was able to get an adult card. I was so proud to finally be able to check out any book in the library, instead of being confined to the children's section. Not everybody loves books these days. It's getting rarer, I fear. Anyway, I spend hours there and get as many books that my book bag will hold, and I bring them home. I really hate to leave the library. I keep the books through both renews, until I'm forced to bring them back, and then I do it all over again. I take full advantage of inter-library loans and holds. Library days have and will always be such VERY special days of my life.",Talks at Google,en,0.992771565914154

I've never heard of any feminist movement in countries in the middle of a war.Now, I'm not saying women aren't as much a part of a war as men, but they're not the ones at the front lines or even in mandatory military service (like we have here in Switzerland).This is not what I believe at the moment but it's interesting to think about.",Talks at Google,en,0.9235491752624512

You, Harari, do not understand it, nor do you have a clue of what it is about. The Old Testament and The New Testament describes in metaphorical language the origin of life and the nature of reality, as intuited and understood by the prophets, most of whom were put to death.  Simply put, there is a Higher Intelligence, Consciousness or Mind, from which all else including humanity, which shares in its intelligence and consciousness, were created and evolved.  ¬†No scientist so far has been able to explain consciousness, or ever will be able to explain it. Neither has any scientist been able to come up with what life is or what its origin is.  Yet there is all this certainty and dismissal of religion which does explain it. The creation of sparks of life from Life itself, which Life can be explained by the words Consciousness, Mind or God, the origin of all that exists, as nothing exists outside it‚Äôs Omnipresence.¬†When you and your fellow atheists are able to explain Life and Consciousness, we will be willing to listen.

One could not and should not whistle in the forest any forest, at night, at night in a forest, in the house, in any house, at night in any house, and on or during a journey, any journey. If a question as to why is that, which would be asked by anyone young with most attention....! The question would strictly be answered, by pointing the indisputable fact that even a young person would straight away understand, the one being that in doing so, evil spirits, demons and the devil itself would be invited and join anyone involved in such a activity. Now when considering that the advice is related to folklore and putting together all the specific places anyone should not whistle, it can be quickly understood that the answer is exactly and very precisely right, although the definitions of what could be invited is with most people more folklore than folklore as actual present reality. With each of the locations identified and in relation to as far back as folklore goes with and within human existence, whistling gives to anyone happening to be in and around any and each of such locations, your precious movement and as consequence a point of reference to where anyone is, and when taken as a totally of a folklore existence, anyone listening to anyone whistling in such locations and period of a day whistling, is more likely than not a more or less real physical representation of a evil spirit, demon or a devil. Folklore tales of many societies present the exact same structure in different ways and methods, religious parables do the same, some of these folklore tales are by now very famous and in every part of the modern society, with one very particular oddity added. Which is the structure, the folklore tales where developed to represent in the first place has been striped away completely, in fact the tales have been turned in some marvelous utopian fantasies for all sorts of reasons and logic. What is more fascinating is that the folklore tales have already pointed to this happening as far back as very far back. One specific folklore tale that has precisely pointed this phenomenon in happening is known as (Hansel and Gretel). The whole structure of the tale is constructed in the definition and meaning of a strange house that is made out of (sweets and cakes). If anyone were to ask anyone, to point out, now, in modern ((times))....! Where are these house's made of (sweets and cakes) now in the present just as in the old folklore tales...!?!? Why are these house's there...!?!? And...! Who owns, develops, and run's such house's made out of (sweets and cakes) ...!?!? What would anyone answer, or what would be the answer to such questions......!That is not the point, the point is this....! A true representation of these folklore tales, a very specific one, a reality one, that I will bring attention to is known by many in the world as (Anne Frank). And my point is this...! Fascism has already won, it won a long ((time)) ago, and it is now alive and well nurtured with and within anyone, especially the self claimed anti fascists. You see the story of Anne Frank points to something very crucial in relation to fascism and anyone involved with and within it. That is the usage of all what anyone has cultured in order to destroy anyone else which what is cultured with and within anyone is or seems to be against that specific anyone as being. It is beyond violence, because it insists to walk step by step, breath by breath, laughter by laughter, ridicule by ridicule, paranoia by paranoia, torture by torture, word by word that specific anyone chosen for destruction. With an extra addition...! That of the end, being presented with the very face or face's of what is destroying anyone, taking full pleasure in the act, one that anyone about to be destroyed will have a lot of suffering from as a self witnessed experience. That is exactly what did happen to Anne Frank and her family, described be her very own words.This what I have just tried to describe I have observed it in happening with and within anyone, including myself, old and young, man and woman, no matter the religion, race or ideology, throughout the media, music, and all arts, together with science, with most of each being very much against fascism.Because....!There are two sentences that would describe anyone's standing in this world with guaranteed certainty. Yet if any of the two is read, heard, or worded by anyone's self, for most people either sentence would make an absolute sense or no sense at all, and the lines if any of the sentence applies to anyone are very clear and distinct in most of the cases. Meaning.... A categorical (I care) or a categorical (I don't care) as it applies or not to anyone, will be ready and without any lack of confidence for either case, together with middle few/many, that would use a doubtful (I would like to, but I usually do not put much attention to that type of thought, and life is more complicated than that). Because of that, I will try and give a different explanation to the sentences, keeping the (meaning) that each refers to, while simultaneously not using it at all.The sentences are...! (Walking with God.) And ..... (Walking with devil.) Between the two sentences there is an enormous difference, all because of the historical, linguistics and civilization forms of being related for anyone on earth. If we take the meaning of one as related to the word (good), while the meaning of the other as related to the word (bad)....! Then a easy definition for each is there to be had, all related to what anyone knows and recognises as (good) or (bad). In the basis of that...! Meaning that anyone can leave out what is understood by the words (God) and (devil), instead keeping only what is understood by the words (good) and (bad).....! Then the sentences have a different understanding, but although once this understanding is with and within anyone, it will be soon realised that nothing has changed by changing the words, the meaning is exactly the same in all possible aspects of existence no matter the period or person.The meaning of each sentence once a little experience of any period of life has been lived by anyone in this planet, is this....! Walking with (good). Means that everything that life has to offer is there, but the walk, it's initiation, it's intention, it's developing, and it's maintaining is always with and within one purpose, creating as a consequence a belief, that it's end together with the purpose is (good).  Walking with (bad). Means that everything that life has to offer is there also (exactly as in walking with good). But it's initiation, it's intention, it's developing, and it's maintaining is always with and within one purpose, and exactly as in the sentence of (walking with good), it creates as a consequence, a firm belief that it's end, is exactly as it's purpose, weather it is stated or accepted as being so.Being that a meaning for the words (God) and (devil) is very much debatable, then what remains is a meaning for the words (good) and (bad). Being that a meaning for the words (good) and (bad) is also very much debatable, and as with the words (God) and (devil), often none existent or without a relatable meaning (as it can be interchangable by anyone as in the example:  (good is bad, and bad is good).....! Then a question arises for a simple answer....! What is there that remains as an understanding, for and related to anyone on earth.The abstract meaning for each sentence is related to the fact, that each sentence refers to a statement as being (something) separate that anyone can walk with, but as a consequence of what walking, is both a sentence which also refers to anyone's self simultaneously. As in the example of anyone walking as themselves (by themselves), walking with others (as themselves) and vice versa together with everything that surrounds anyone at any given period on earth (as themselves). With this in mind..... (What is there that remains as an understanding, for and related to anyone on earth?) type of question....! Takes the being form of (the problem), wether it is admitted or not.¬© Mir14 March/2023",Talks at Google,en,0.9611620306968688

Then the last question was just trolling. This is not an intellectual discussion. It is like showing up to class not having done the homework. I'm worried that these engineers are not doing science. They have their own ideas and are not looking critically at their own paradigms. This is why large language models are not able to get AGI because the people they are testing it do not think critically they just regurgitate facts and do not create anything. the hardware will only go as far as the people who train it. this is a good example of what you put into a system is what you get out. this to me explains a lot about both google and why we are were we are in this process.,Talks at Google,en,0.9886221289634703

So, you could say meditation is a way of becoming one with your life. Whereas mediation is about bringing two differing points of view, or two different sets of interests or a conflict in which there are many parties, into one solution.‚Äù‚ÄúConflict is, by its nature, threatening to the status quo.‚Äù‚ÄúCommit to experiencing the sensation. Stop the thoughts. Experience the sensation. Literally receive them. Get to know them.‚Äù‚ÄúMeditation is one of the great ways that we have of navigating our interior and heightening the discipline, if you will, of how we perceive.‚Äù‚ÄúWe all know that there are certain developmental tasks that get accomplished at certain ages (in children). But, the same is true of adults. We also can expand and grow our perspectives.‚Äù‚ÄúI started to see that there were limits to capacity. And the capacity that I started to notice was the capacity to take perspectives ‚Ä¶ What I was seeing was just a whole range of people who had different capacity to take different points of view.‚Äù‚ÄúIf you have two coexisting truths in your head at any one time, you literally have to deal with the disruption in your body.‚Äù‚ÄúThere was a much smaller group of people who not only could they hold one, two, perhaps three, they could hold four, five, six perspectives at once. They could take a perspective on the process. They could think about how the process had evolved from the past and where it might go in the future. They could think about what the impact of the facilitator was on the process.‚Äù‚ÄúThis perspective taking, and the capacity to take perspectives, changes the heart of negotiation at such a fundamental level.‚Äù‚ÄúI don't just assume that everybody's capacity is the same. I assume that there are differences in capacity and that I have to take that into account.‚Äù‚ÄúIn order to maintain an identity, there are things that I have to keep out of it. Jung referred to the shadow as anything that I cannot bring into my identity as me.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen human beings go to war with each other, one of the first things we do is dehumanize the enemy. Because the enemy has to become ‚Äònot me‚Äô. If it's not me, then I can abuse you, I can kill you, I can destroy you. But, as soon as you're like me, I no longer can do that.‚ÄùEgocentric self: ‚ÄúThe ego is not bad, the ego is limited. The ego is oriented toward self-sustaining. But, there is such a thing as a healthy ego. There's a healthy ecosystem of self which is permeable and which can take inputs and give out inputs. And, then the perspective can shift to include more. An ego becomes bad when an ego is exclusive. A healthy ego is one that has permeability and is able to drop its reference points and expand awareness ‚Ä¶ Wherever there's an egocentric self, there's a sense of the other, so there's self and other ‚Ä¶ One of the conditions that we want to pay attention to whenever we're identifying as the ego is that there's a sense of separation‚Äîand because there's a sense of separation, there's stress.‚ÄùEthnocentric self: ‚ÄúWe're going to grow our perspectives from the self to the group ‚Ä¶ The ethnocentric self feels safe in my group, but your group can sometimes feel threatening to me ‚Ä¶ The values were the ones of the people, my tribe, the people I belonged with ‚Ä¶ At the egocentric level, there's self and other; at the ethnocentric level, there‚Äôs us and them ‚Ä¶ The boundary around what's ‚Äòme‚Äô and what's ‚Äònot me‚Äô at ethnocentric is strong.‚ÄùWorld-centric self: ‚ÄúIf you can cross the barrier of ‚Äòus and them‚Äô, you're already established at what we would call a world-centric level of development ‚Ä¶ In the same way the ego is too small, then all of a sudden, so is my ethnocentric identity ‚Ä¶ At ethnocentric, difference is threatening. At world-centric, difference is embraced ‚Ä¶ My capacity to identify with all of humanity and to really enjoy and appreciate the differences is fully online.‚ÄùCosmic-centric self: ‚ÄúCosmic-centric transcends and includes world-centric, healthy ethnocentrism, and healthy egocentric ‚Ä¶ Where is that boundary of identity? You're limitless ‚Ä¶ I can't quite identify the boundaries of space or time ‚Ä¶ Identity itself has dissolved, and when identity itself dissolves, I'm completely open. And, I'm relaxed in a way that's really fundamental. I feel really at home ‚Ä¶ I'm completely in the here and now, my awareness is wide open, there's no sense of limit ‚Ä¶ There's nothing that is beyond what I am, so I'm simply embedded in the breadth of all things.‚Äù",Talks at Google,en,0.9233417510986328

The autism helps me see complex patterns in people's problems and pick up on every little micro-expression, etc, plus I'm allowed to put what discrepancies I see into words, and there are scripts on how to treat every kind of problem. Of course, the person would probably get a different treatment from a neurotypical therapist, but most of my clients tell me they feel the treatment is very helpful. They say I'm annoyingly direct, but that that's what helped them, since I told it to them straight, where they can hide with other therapists.

Except for the free will stuff. He's clearly afraid something horrible would happen to society and the law if people came to understand that free will doesn't really exist. I don't share his fear. Most people denying free will seem very sensible grounded individuals. And the reasons they give are much better than the strawman Dennett presents here. I think his fear took him over and much intelligent people have many ways of rationalising their fears to themselves. His compatibilism never really took off outside of academia, and that's probably for the better. Not in the least for all his own other work. It's all genetics and memetics, and the self is a benign user illusion... but it has free will? It is not needed to make this move. But it is very hard to change your mind on something you've written and published a book about. I think his slight of hand on the free will thing will be soon forgotten and all his amazing work on consciousness, the self, religion, evolution and memetics will live on for a long long time.

I think that this is a major understatement. I want to point out that the written word is the greatest tool for improving our thinking.

That is in some way superficial and can be mitigated by the magic of screen craft. No, the problem with Cruise is that we all know far too much about the actor in his real life and his off screen behaviour is so wildly at odds with the kind of character for Reacher that we have in our imaginations. Whereas Reacher is down to earth and the consummate pragmatist, he‚Äôs also a true romantic. What we know about Cruise is opposite to both these things. He really does seem to be a cookey narcissist, with outrageous beliefs, who is is incapable of real empathy or emotional commitment. And however well Cruise acts, these days we just know far too much about him and it‚Äôs began to make it hard to like him as a person and this erodes our capacity for buying into any role he portrays that is at all sympathetic these days.

She spoke about this in an interview. When the show was casting, Aubrey was suggested by a casting director who was intrigued by her funny, unconventional energy and suggested she audition for the show. At the time, Aubrey wasn't looking to be in a sitcom but she went because she was already in LA for a movie she was doing, and as a then fan of The Office she was distracted by meeting at the same place that show was filming. Originally the character was going to be a dumb woman who messed up constantly and wouldn't last long, but when she met the showrunners, Aubrey told them that a better direction was the April you experience in the show. She pitched them the character's position, personality and role in the story, and she based much of April's nature on her sister.

He lacked a very important dimension though: demographic pressure. That's the root cause of violence. When it's about needs, wars or epidemics can release the pressure. When it's about comfort goods debt solves it by creating categories of access to goods and services. Simple example, not everyone can have a private jet, but private jets are a thing, so categories can solve it. I agree that we got money wrong, in the sense that it doesn't reward the right things through current political mechanisms. By definition, trying to make money is trying to get other people in your debt. And everybody is trying hard ignoring that some guys above with big guns are printing it and pouring it wherever they please. Ultimately, force is structurally relevant, but it lacks vision or purpose, so money distribution is the key part and democratically voted budgets was supposed to solve that. But it was hijacked because in the end, human population is always 50 years away from doubling if fed and not busy... According to me, this particular matter is really in the hands of God and those mechanisms have pulled up from the fields to this internet thing in a record time.

I'm not so interested in what happened 5000 years ago, but I am interested in what happened over the last 500 years, as society grew up.""Before the use of Money was known, Goods were exchang'd by Barter, orContract; and Contracts were made payable in Goods. This State of Barter was inconvenient, and disadvantageous. 1. He who desir'd toBarter would not always find People who wanted the Goods he had, and had suchGoods as he desir'd in Exchange.2. Contracts taken payable in Goods were uncertain, for Goods of the same kinddiffer'd in value.3. There was no measure by which he Proportion of Value Goods had to oneanother could be known.In this State of Barter there was little Trade, and few Arts-men. The Peopledepended on the Landed-men. The Landed-men labour'd only so much of the Landas serv'd the occasions of their Families, to barter for such necessaries as theirLand did not produce; and to lay up for Seed and bad Years. What remain'd wasunlabour'd; or gifted on condition of Vassalage, and other Services.The Losses and Difficulties that attended Barter, would force the Landed-men to agreater consumption of the Goods of their own Product, and a lesser Consumptionof other Goods; or to supply themselves, they would turn the Land to the productof the several Goods they had occasion for; tho only proper to produce of onekind. So, much of the Land uas unlabour'd,what was labour'd was not employ'd tothat by which it would have turn'd to most Advantage, nor the People to theLabour they were most fit for.Silver as a Metal had a value in Barter, as other Goods; from the Uses it was thenapply'd to.As Goods of the same kind differ'd in value, so Silver differ'd from Silver, as itwas more or less fine.Silver was lyable to a change in its Value, as other Goods, from any change in itsQuantity, or in the Demand for it.Silver had Qualities which fitted it for the use of Money.1. It could be brought to a Standard in Fineness, so was certain as to its Quality.2. It was easie of Delivery.3.

Nearly every other film on the topic (e.g. Paprika, The Cell, Source Code, The Matrix, even Nightmare on Elm Street) does it better.

His ego won't let him admit that the Rock-afire Explosion kicked his New Jersey rat's ass and he didn't just get tired of winning.  He was booted out of CEC in 1984 for egregious mismanagement. And he lied about winning the law suit.  It was settled for a quarter of what he claims to have won. Poor guy. I'm glad I turned him down when he asked me to sell him my characters in 1977 and then my company in 1978. I knew he couldn't be trusted.  And I wouldn't trust a word of this entire speech.

These mindsets don‚Äôt coexist well within the same person, which is why lady Gaga is always so focused on what her energy communicates while the CEO is inclined to only see things literally.I remember when I was a stem major in college being very cynical towards the ‚Äòmeaningless layered‚Äô expressions artists tend to make when describing their views, and I saw a lot of it as irrational or unnecessary, doing too much etc, but when I changed majors to psychology I was finally free to focus on and realize the importance of emotional energy and how most people are watching your energy and not very concerned with your words. Unfortunately, with the way our school system works;  success in the ‚Äòimportant‚Äô subjects is driven by your ability to keep a tunnel vision around the specific inquiry, making elaboration unnecessary or fruitless. There are very few open-minded, discussion based teaching methods employed so most kids learn to become very copy and paste oriented instead of curious and expanding of potential connections between subjects oriented because that is what is successful in our school systems",Talks at Google,en,0.9324252009391784

This analysis is crucial for the success of cutting-edge treatments such as immunotherapy. However, the immense size and detail of pathology images pose significant challenges for typical vision transformers. The GigaPath project aims to tackle this by developing scalable architectures for modeling pathology images and creating a large-scale, multimodal, longitudinal foundation model.This project uses techniques like dilated attention (LongNet) to increase transformer scalability for such high-resolution images.  In collaboration with Providence Hospital, a massive real-world cancer patient dataset is being compiled, including clinical notes, genomics data, radiology images and reports, and pathology slides.  GigaPath explores self-supervised learning approaches across different modalities to make the most of this valuable data. The ultimate goal is to develop a foundation model that unlocks insights from this real-world data, advancing AI for cancer care and research. i used gemini",Microsoft Research,en,0.9632716774940492

One concern related to using LLMs as emulators is that it could magnify our inferior knowledge about the world's physics by performing experiments based on our emulated world model instead of the real-world model as we did in the conventional case.

Explaining the LASER Intervention  - 01:15 Presentation of LASER, which involves selecting a weight matrix of an LLM and creating a low-rank approximation of it.  - 01:32 Description of the transformer architecture consisting of multiple transformer blocks, each with several weight matrices.  - 01:48 Selection of a specific weight matrix to illustrate the LASER process.  - 02:01 Description of singular value decomposition (SVD) used for low-rank approximation and the computational efficiency of the process.  - 02:39 Identification of three choices in performing a LASER intervention: which layer to select, which weight matrix to edit, and the level of approximation.   Benefits of LASER and Its Evaluation  - 03:03 Mention of LASER's ability to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs, enabling broader accessibility.  - 03:24 Evaluation of LASER on the GPT-J LLM using the counterfact question answering dataset to assess model robustness to paraphrases.  - 03:55 Observation that, contrary to expectations, the right LASER intervention can decrease model loss instead of increasing it, indicating an improvement in the pre-trained LLM.  - 04:24 Analysis of the impact of applying LASER to different layers of an LLM, with earlier layers increasing loss and later layers decreasing loss when more approximation is performed.   Generalizability and Analysis of LASER's Effects  - 04:52 Confirmation that LASER's surprising results hold across multiple tasks and different LLMs like Roberta, GPT-J, and LLama2.  - 05:02 Reports of significant performance improvements in certain tasks following LASER intervention.  - 05:20 Brief mention of additional analyses, including gains from rare data points in training data and the removal of semantically correct but erroneous responses by LASER, likening it to a denoising process.   Conclusion  - 05:50 Summary of LASER as an intervention method for LLMs that can increase accuracy while reducing memory usage.  - 06:07 Direction to the paper on arXiv and its upcoming presentation at the iClear conference.  - 06:16 Closing of the talk.Disclaimer: I used gpt4-1106 to summarize the video transcript.

Allow me to illustrate. Humans don't need the same quantity of examples to learn patterns. Also, the brain uses much less energy to do what it does than an LLM. Third, the human brain can reason when its exposed to a phenomenon its never seen before. Next token prediction is based on statistics abstracted from a large body of examples.

Modern LLMs are quite capable at reasoning about contexts or scenarios they‚Äôve never seen before. This is called zero-shot learning. They are also capable of learning patterns from a very small number of samples; this is called few-shot learning. GPT-4, for example, does both zero-shot and few-shot learning extremely well. I‚Äôm not sure why you thought they weren‚Äôt capable of this, but you‚Äôre very wrong.Also, while it is true that the average person‚Äôs brain is capable of learning new patterns with relatively few samples, this does not happen in a vacuum; by the time a human‚Äôs brain is capable of doing this that brain has already processed many orders of magnitude more information than modern LLMs are trained on.

This operation is very metabolically expensive so the brain have optimized its behavior to reduce the amounts of this function invocation, but it is critical to reinforcing the predictions of the model. This is where the constraint of the environment, makes the brain more efficient and adaptable.Potentially how it can be solved is to have RAG serve as an actual input that corresponds to what in reasoning is the existing knowledge base, and in vision is light rays. What is missing from there is a reinforcement learning model applied on the predictions with the goal function being derived from the evaluation of the RAG invocation.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9903905391693116

The point of glass storage is that it's one of the most chemically stable material out there. HDDs are prone to mechanical failure and of course their magnetic discs rot overtime. Same with LTO tapes. CDs are made of plastic and use light-sensitive dye coating which also deteriorates after a few years. There are M-Discs and Gold DVDs which use a metal coat instead of organic coating, making it much more durable and can potentially last for hundreds of years in the right condition, but they cannot store nearly as much data as compared to LTO tapes. Microsoft's glass storage is a replacement of LTO tapes and is intended to be used in an archival library, similar to that of a tape library where everything is sorted via mechanical robot.

Csaba Szepesvari's Perspective: (2:30 - 4:10)   - Csaba Szepesvari from the University of Alberta and DeepMind highlights the potential and challenges in making RL algorithms more robust and scalable. He expresses interest in applications and the need for further research, particularly in areas like partial observability. 4. Sham Kakade's Viewpoint: (4:10 - 5:26)   - Sham Kakade, a professor at the University of Washington and researcher at Microsoft, discusses his work in AI and machine learning, with a focus on RL and natural language processing. He finds the results in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning using planning algorithms to be particularly intriguing. 5. Joelle Pineau's Contributions: (5:26 - 7:31)   - Joelle Pineau from McGill University and Facebook AI Research Labs talks about her journey in RL research, with a focus on healthcare and robotics applications. She emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, scientific integrity, and considering broader criteria like fairness and safety in RL. 6. Craig Boutilier's Remarks: (7:31 - 10:55)   - Craig Boutilier from Google Research discusses his focus on user-centric recommender systems and the critical role of RL in understanding user preferences. He identifies gaps in RL, particularly in dealing with latent state, complex action spaces, and behavioral phenomena. 7. Panel Discussion on Combinatorial Thinking in RL: (10:55 - 32:42)   - Initial discussion on handling combinatorial challenges in RL, focusing on generalization and compositionality in action and state spaces (10:55 - 20:26).   - Further exploration of theoretical aspects, such as the interplay between representations and dynamics, and the impact of RL's interactive nature on learning and generalization (20:26 - 32:42). 8. Exploring Special vs. General-Purpose Architectures in RL: (32:42 - 43:56)   - Introduction of the topic comparing special-purpose architectures versus general-purpose architectures in RL, with specific references to value iteration networks and transformers (32:42 - 33:59).   - Discussion on the efficacy of different architectures in RL, the importance of rigorous experimentation, and the potential limitations and strengths of these architectures (33:59 - 43:56). 9. Closing Remarks: (43:56 - 44:19)   - Geoff Gordon thanks the panelists for their insights and contributions, suggesting the need for a follow-up discussion given the depth of topics covered.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9296793937683104

Sanders and Austin Taranta from Honeywell and the Optoelectronics Research Center at the University of Southampton in the UK describe how they used a new type of hollow-core optical fiber. This allowed them to increase the stability requirements of the gyroscope by 500 times compared to other fiber optic gyroscopes.‚ù§‚ù§With the help of the ‚ÄúHYBRID gyroscope‚Äù you can make scientific discoveries; in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, higher theoretical physics,...I am writing to you with a proposal for the joint invention of a HYBRID gyroscope from non-circular, TWO coils with a new type of optical fiber with a ‚Äúhollow core photonic-substituted vacuum zone or (NANF)‚Äù where - the light travels 48000 meters in each arm, while it does not exceed the parameters 40/40/40 cm, and the weight is 4 kg. Manufacturers of ‚ÄúFiber Optic Gyroscopes‚Äù can produce HYBRID gyroscopes for educational and practical use in schools and higher education institutions.Einstein dreamed of measuring the speed of a train, an airplane - through the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1881/2024, and only then would the experiment be more than 70% complete. This can be done using a fiber optic HYBRID gyroscope. Based on the completion of more than 70% of Michelson's experiment, the following postulates can be proven: Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta, and dominant gravitational fields adjust the speed of light in a vacuum.(We are not looking for ether, we will see the work of gravitational quanta) The result is a ¬´theory of everything¬ª in a simple teaching device and a new tape measure for measuring the universe.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9447581768035888

From the point view of digital signal processing, a small downsampling ratio implies large sampling rate which preserves more frequency info (high freq info); a small filter window size (patch size) implies fewer frequency choices of the filter (frequency resolution), which means ""smoother"" in the corresponding continual domain, and therefore reduces instability. As for translation invariance, fine-grind filters (via more layers) work for not only global but also local translation invariances.Another understanding from me about using small patch size for CNN is, although in signal process field a lager filter window size is preferred, here in CNN the tasks are mainly for classification rather than reconstructing the signal, and therefore stability is more important.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9922903180122375

I am glad to see it even get this far. I have posited some ideas of my own with friends. Imagine, this being tied to 'Neurallink' or a similar technology. Kept on the body in a safe location only known to the user, like a very small Biological Hard drive, to help store all those extra 'Petabytes', we accumulate in our brains as images and sounds, then processed by our 'Minds' Cognitive' functions, but with 'Error Checking'. A concern of mine and not mentioned is how are they generating the 'Cells' and 'Vials' contents at the moment. Is it synthesised? From human discarded/Non-discarded skin cells (others) or is there some specific requirements for the initial cell. I see they strip all this off and only capture the nuclei (Super Clever and a bit of a secret I imagine?).

And although I understood all the things in the book it just recently clicked for me and everything made sense. Keep with my thought. Probably most of you have had hard time working out, studying or doing something else that you knew it needed to be done, but it was hard and you felt lazy. I know I did. Everybody around us tells us that we need to be disciplined, ambitious, have will power to do things that needed to be done, although we felt inner resilience against them. I know I have talked to myself: "" Why do I feel this repulsion against studying, or something else. I need to enforce it, use my willpower, etc."" Bullshit! Go again to the brain activity of the rat. It looks lazy, unmotivated, but its brain is working like hell. That's your inner resilience against new things. Your brain doesn't want new things, and when it deals with it, it uses a lot of energy to process the new thing. That's why when you start something new, you can't do much fruitful work, you are quickly exhausted, etc. But when you do just enough regularly, as much as you can every time, without being harsh on yourself, you notice how you can do more and more work, much more effectively, without inner resilience or feeling exhausted. That's the habit stage, the brain no longer is on fire processing new info. In summary, when you start something new, it's absolutely normal to not achieve much, feel quickly exhausted and have inner resilience. The more you do the habit, the more it sticks, until you reach a moment when you can study for several hours in a row, and feel great. That's when you start achieving your goals . Hope you understood my idea.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9910632371902466

I understand this double speak and was steered towards this video. I will once again warn that inducing unnatural frequencies to the earth will bring about the end of this evolution of man. On December 29th I predicted HAARP‚Äôs event to induce the earthquake in Japan on January 1st.Do as you like, kill the messenger in the literal sense, deplatform them, but it will not change the coarse of the events that will unfold. They have done it before and the only reaction was the desired earthquake and tsunami. Be aware you are playing with forces you don‚Äôt control. You don‚Äôt know if the effects are isolated or if they are cumulative. There is an affinity between Earth and the Sun. Like a tuning fork they sing the same song when they are assaulted. There will be no winter as scientists suggest. Not a single asteroid will destroy earth. The core of the earth is molten and suspended by energy. It won‚Äôt be destroyed but all life on it will be.  Bunkering in molten earth is comical. The idea of anchoring in an orbit of a planet is now glowing like the sun is also comical. When our arrogant rulers trigger the event don‚Äôt think of a single meteor entering our orbit. Think of millions of different sized particles entering our atmosphere drawn to it in a magnetic field and igniting the surface. When the crust of the earth nearly matches the core. Essentially creating a 2nd sun in our orbit. The rich will not survive it.Oh and the sites of crop circles and landmarks like the pyramids are points of the earth where energy is radiated. This is the force that gives us life. They move and change location around the earth. When they are active the frequency radiated holds the shape of DNA while electricity imparts life. We are electricity and when all electrical activity ceases in living tissue it‚Äôs declared dead and begins to decay. The jelly like matter found at the sites and is the matter we and all creatures are made of. This explains ghosts and astral travel, and what the government defined as remote viewing. The spirit or electrical activity leaves the body. Light is not the fastest moving energy in the universe. The trinity are all derived from the same energy. Tesla knew the answer.If one becomes active it could be the creation of a beetle or some other creature you aren‚Äôt looking for. They exists under the oceans as well. People that have seen them form aren‚Äôt looking for the creature because they are in awe at the crop circle. The important part to note it the earth  radiates frequencies out, no the other way around. By inducing unnatural frequencies in might cause a seemingly cool earthquake of tsunami  causing mass destruction, but this is a cumulative effect and doing it shortens our duration of life on earth.Part of the theory you are presenting is smart in regards to developing tech. Permitting the private sector to work on it speeds progress, but balancing secrecy Vs. development is a balance.It‚Äôs hard to instill fear into people that realize they are energy and can‚Äôt be destroyed. Their body can die but they can manifest in other places.

Susan seemed to have a phenomenal memory, and she has got an excellent memory, but the gentleman who raised the question had a good point about pattern recognition. They showed Susan for three seconds a fairly full chess position. She instantly replicated this. Then they showed her for three seconds a position with the pieces scattered on random squares. In this case her memory was not a lot better than anyone else's. They said that in the first case she used a memory, or recognition, technique known as 'chunking', whereby certain groups or patterns of pieces, for example the king in a corner behind three pawns with maybe a rook at f8 and a knight at f6, occur typically in a normal chess game. The random position they showed her was never, if ever, likely to occur in any actual game.",Microsoft Research,en,0.990631341934204

This is apparently astronomical. A video about Susan Polgar stated that the number of possible games, or maybe it was the number of moves in the number of possible games, was greater than the number of atoms in the known universe. But balance this against the fact that at the top level of human chess the game, under classical time-control of two hours per forty moves, has become very sterile. There is draw after draw and the match is decided on rapid-play shoot-out, like a penalty shoot-out in soccer. Or when one player does manage a win under classical time-control, it is ground out at move a hundred and something from a tiny advantage maintained deep into the endgame, a la Magnus Carlsen. Why? Because the number of POSSIBLE  games is radically different from the number of PROBABLE games, where the openings run along lines of a far more limited number of recognised good sensible moves. Admittedly the superhuman chess programmes like Stockfish and Alpha-Zero play games among themselves that do not end in draws, proving that chess is not played out, 'solved' or exhausted.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9548065066337584

They drained my finances to help with their renovation and threw me out on the street shortly after with no money, or possessions post pandemic 2021-22.I was homeless for almost two years and regardless of the suffering I went through I loved being free. I am finally learning to heal at 43. I still think about all of the years of terror and coercive manipulation.  All of the years lost to the plowman's",Microsoft Research,en,0.9883665442466736

It could be - write down a plan for the project. ""Write a paper"" forces correctness onto the idea, whereas a plan is free to be incorrect and modified. It's also fundamentally challenging to have claimed to have done the work before even starting the work (papers are typically written in such language). It is much more natural to declare a promise of the work. The main objective behind the ""model 2"" is that the research should be well-motivated, well-defined, and there should be a concrete plan in place. This is just standard practice for good project management, told in a more confusing term of ""write the paper"".Step 2 could instead be ""write down a plan for your project"".",Microsoft Research,en,0.9923535585403442

For example, if individuals with specific amounts of hearing loss in various frequencies all preferred a set or range of HRTFs, that would indicate that synthesized HRTF could be used as a way to correct for distorted HRTF perception due to hearing loss, (like a corrective glasses prescription or frequency corrected hearing aid). That leads to a conclusion that individual hearing loss would be problematic to synthesized HRTF unless that synthesized HRTF is able to be personalized based on the person‚Äôs individual hearing losses and being used as sort of a ‚Äúsuper hearing aid‚Äú, therefore correcting for spatial perception within a Euclidian space as a result of having first corrected for their individual hearing loss per frequency.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9735358357429504

A complex painting has a lot of steps to it, as does a long algorithm and it can be hard for both types of people to break it down and understand the details. I believe only by looking at details and patterns can either person be successful.This can be applied to any field, communication, sports, whatever.Like the magic square problem vs the look at the object in reverse or upside point of view, both are ways to solve things.

In the context of Python, it is a little ambiguous and vague.Bytecode is a concept that exists outside of Python. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode . In general, it refers to the instruction set of a virtual machine. As correctly mentioned in this talk, it is portable . This was Nicholas Wirth's motivation for introducing it. For high-level bytecode as is found in Python, it is generally compact as well. This is shown implicitly in this and other talks.This compactness was another major factor for its widespread use. Think Turbo Pascal and old IBM PC DOS systems on Intel pre-i386 systems, Intel 8080 and the old Apple Synertek 6502.In the context of Python (and in other bytecode systems), the instructions are organized as a series of amorphous bytes (the ""byte"" part of ""bytecode""), and the first step of a consumer of bytecode like a disassembler or interpreter is to turn these bytes into instructions . Starting with Python 3.6, the disassembler module do a better job at separating these two concepts. Why it took 20 years and something like 30 versions of Python clarify this in the code organization, is to me a bit sad.In 3.6 there was a small push to coin a new word, ""wordcode"" instead of bytecode since the format switched from one largely one-byte or three-byte instructions to uniformly two-byte instructions. That concept hasn't stuck.Which brings me one small clarification regarding the length of an instruction. While in one sense you can say that ""instructions"" are one or three bytes before Python 3.6, conceptually, that is not true. When an integer operand value is larger than what can fit in two bytes (pre Python 3.6) or one byte (post Python 3.6). Then one or more ""instructions"" called EXTENDED_ARG  is used. So several ""instructions"" are really part of one logical instruction.So I guess in addition to ""bytecode"" being a little vague, so is ""bytecode instruction"". In the Python context, ""bytecode"", as distinct from the general concept of bytecode, refers to the amorphous bytestring instruction part of the overall bytecode encoding system.It is good in this talk to point out the incompleteness or vagueness of ""dis"" output. As this and other talks point out there are those other fields in the Python's code object that exist. Some of these bits of information is melded into the disassembly output so you can kind of infer what those tables are. For example you can reconstruct the constants pool co_consts   and the various name tables from disassembly output. Other fields like the flags for the code object, or the ""filename"" that the code object came from one can't infer.However since 2016 (after this talk came out) there is a better disassembler called xdis https://pypi.org/project/xdis/ that shows this information.A tough problem of any talk on ""Python bytecode"" is that there are something like 40 variants and the drift from the first version to the latest is like the drift in languages between German to Norwegian with Dutch, Danish and Swedish along the way. As a result most projects that use Python's  dis  module tend to suffer the problem that they need a little to a lot of tweaking for the next version of Python. And that they work only for the version of Python interpreter running the tool.The tool mentioned here, Maynard, apparently suffers this problem - there were only two versions ever released. Byterun which uses xdis has the same problem. So again , xdis can assist here a little bit, although tweaking from version to version is still necessary.I could write a bit more about little small corrections that would have made this talk just a tad better. Small example: using the word ""Computation Operations"" rather than ""Arithmetic Operations"" because one does not think of string and possibly boolean operations (""contains"", or ""is in"") as ""Arithmetic"". However let me leave it that if this talk is given again or if anyone in the future has a talk on bytecode, if you run the talk by me I'd be happy to make suggestions or corrections.",EuroPython Conference,en,0.9822478890419006
