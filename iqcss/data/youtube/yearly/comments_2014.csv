For me, the hardest part was not being in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather the bigger struggle was coming back home. From 2006 to 2010 I served in combat every one of those years, so when they decided to downsize the Marine Corps I was let go, thus taking away my power base of my brothers that served with me during that time. I was at a loss, because being with them was very therapeutic for me. A part of me wanted to stay in because they were there, and another part of me wanted to get out because I didn't want my combat experiences to be the sole defining portion of my life. Most days after getting out I would lock myself indoors staring at the world outside. I did everything from changing my appearance to how I acted to hide the fact that I was even in the service. If I was out, I would put a brave face on, but I was still there. My destructiveness was not from turning to drugs or alcohol, rather it was from me hiding myself from society. Only close friends and family knew that I was in, but they don't and probably won't know the whole story of being in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was at a loss.Lately seeing how America takes on issues made me change the way I saw myself. We treat America as one big soap opera and tend to focus on problems rather than solutions. Around late 2013 my life had come to a full circle, I began to focus on solutions. The solution for me was to ask myself what I was passionate about, what was my driving force in life, and why did it have to leave. That passion and driving force in my life is helping those in need. It is the reason why I joined the Marine Corps. Whether it be a smile, a hello, to helping the homeless in my community helped put that purpose back in my life.  Guillermo Cervera has it right. Americans are more individualistic rather than collectivist which is why there is a struggle with returning vets. The military is a collectivist society. We eat, sleep, work, fight, sweat, bleed, cry, and have lived with the most primitive of needs together with the one common goal; the survival of the pack. When we see Americans with a ""what's in it for me"" mentality it pushes us back with no relation to our society and trying to live those collectivist ideals we have learned in combat.22 veterans are committing suicide each day.

This question is in reference to both human internal processing as well as external processing(decay). Which is more efficient at being processed through its cycle and also efficient at serving its purpose?        I did appreciate the logic in your argument about making decisions based on more relevant data (relative to the situation), like whether the substance is objectively good/bad for you & the environment, how it's being used, & in what quantities, how effective/efficient at serving its purpose, as well as what will happen to it after its purpose is fulfilled.       Actually, reminds me of the book ""Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things"", by Michael Braungart & William McDonough, which (among other things) speaks of how there are 2 metabolisms on the planet. There is the Biological metabolism, which refers to all the natural cycles and natural resources (things consumed by microorganisms), and there is the Technical metabolism, which refers to industrial processed compounds & synthetic compounds which should be designed to be upcycled back into the human industrial system much more efficiently than attempting to dilute it into the Biological metabolism.I could go on about how I disagree with Theodore Gray's feelings about the differences between the App Store & the Google Play Store and my belief that the Touchpress apps would sell well on the Android platform, but I will end my comment here. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9762429594993592

Nevertheless, you often preface some of your beliefs with ""research shows"" .... but in a number of cases what you present as conclusive is actually not so ... for example, the idea that our ""consciousness is just a snowball on top of our unconscious"". I would suggest you do much more research.In particular, the research on “attention & automaticity” has gone through many phases. “Snowball on the iceberg” was proposed by Tim Wilson in his book “Strangers to Ourselves.” There is no evidence for this wild claim! This outlook is associated with Bargh’s claim that social behavior is almost completely automatic. It seems very strange that you would support such a belief since your goal seems to be to get people to recognize their “biases” (code for automatic processing) by examining and the beliefs that modulate this process. In order to do so, it takes recognizing that share of conscious processing can play a significant role in social interaction.Using methods of opposition in conscious and automatic processing experimentation allows for greater measurement of components in spontaneous trait inferences. Uleman et al. (2005) demonstrate that conscious processing are often roughly evenly balanced in conditions in which time is not severely curtailed for decision making. Also, Payne (2005) shows that the only time automatic processing dominates in “weapon-bias experiments” takes place is when the response must be within 500 msec.Gladwell also tries to over argue for an exaggerated role of automatic decision making in his book, which unfortunately also exaggerates the “automaticity juggernaut.” I have watched more of your video and I see that you do believe in the power of mindfulness and advocate developing the practice of mindfulness. Great, then please consider getting rid of some of your arguments that are unsupported since for those who are familiar with the multiple aspects of the study of consciousness it is a big “turnoff”. In particular, I am referring to the “snowball on the iceberg” view of conscious/unconscious (subconscious or automaticity) dichotomy.Your focus on awareness of priming as well as on what you call “systems and structure” is also very useful. One final comment is that you might want to consider the benefits of becoming multilingual and multicultural. The process can greatly increase awareness of our thought processes.",Talks at Google,en,0.9478656053543092

That's who told him to go to Oxford and Yale to make connections, and it worked.  Remember how China sponsored Clinton and Gore?  It's not that the U.S. has sold out to China, per se.  Those are the people running China AND the U.S..  They go back to British and Dutch corporations 100-300 years ago.  They conquered the U.S. 100-150 years ago.  That is why banks create money now, not our government.  This is why and how society is run by banks, holding companies, clandestine services, and technocrats.Google's Schmidt and Cohen are right in the middle of it. They know what's going on, they're doing it, and they always pretend like anyone who calls them on it is a whack job.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I'd claim it is the exact opposite; good rules for morality and ethics comes from compassion, reasoning and continuous public debate. Morality and ethics in a society is constantly changing while religion usually oppose change to their tenets and doctrines.The fact that people look to religion (instead of philosophy) for morality is a huge problem. It's one of the reasons we have world problems like ISIS and that HIV is spreading so rampant on the African continent. The latter issue is directly related to the Catholic church favoring abstinence and no sex before marriage over a healthy view on sexuality and claiming that the use of contraceptives is against the faith. Also let's not forget what ""morality"" views many religions have on women's status in society, how to treat apostates, non-believers or believers of different faiths or homosexuals.",Talks at Google,en,0.9603014588356018

Tell us one thing you know to be true about it? For example, a fallacious example was given, among the replies here, that evolution had predicted ""genetic media"" which is pure made up nonsense. Darwin thought that the human cell was literally a glob of jelly. He would've been the very first to have pared his theory down to adaptation -at most- if he had had any idea what awaited science in DNA. With microbiology we have all the elements of design and manufacturing of proteins and intricate body systems. The idea that the information present in DNA somehow created itself because of the environment strains credulity. In no other science but biology do we consider seriously the existence of plans for tools, machinery and unimaginably complex whole interactive and self reheating systems as being made by unguided natural forces.

The point I was making still stands. I know what epistemology means. I know what the fallacy from incredulity means. And I also know what the fallacy of appeal to authority means – – that's your problem. It is you, not I, who needs to crack a book and learn.﻿What I've taught you here is that biology actually evidences design -- especially on the molecular level. There is no other instance in which we observe evidence for design and say ""here's evidence for design and therefore it wasn't"". This is the close mindedness of western thinking.And actually there are alternatives – – the explanatory framework of intelligent design. If it's not even allowed in the theoretical room the no one's going to actually ask the questions and study it. I think what Michael Cremo and others have documented is that there is an aggressive professional and political reaction to anything that goes against the presumed orthodoxy of Darwinism. Careers are destroyed, evidence is ""lost"" or hidden away and ignored, and any objection to the prevailing paradigm doesn't cause a change of the prevailing paradigm it just causes the prevailing paradigm to move the goal posts to some other supposed era or to some new imagined metric. Because it is comprised of ""just – so"" stories-- and not observable evidence--evolution has shown itself immune from the charge of falsifiability and therefore not scientific by definition.

I guess I am going to shoot these questions to him via twitter.He mentioned that there has been enough evidence contradicting the current paradigm. How do you qualify the number of evidences as ""enough""? For eg. for every discovery supporting the current paradigm how many contradictory discoveries have been made (or vice-versa)? Could there be a reason why these are considered anomalies waiting for some other discovery to be made? (Maybe there arent enough number of cases compared to the cases supporting Darwin's evolution theory).If modern humans were there hundreds of millions of years ago, then where on the timeline would you put dinosaurs? If modern humans came so long ago, why did it take millions of years to get where we are today? Going by current paradigm, we have come from discovering agriculture to inventing smartphones in 12000 years. So does it suggest we modern humans are not as smart as implied by the current paradigm?I guess the success of any anthropological paradigm partly depends on its capacity to put forth a theory. So whats the final hypothesis? How did we appear on this planet? It deserves a hypothesis.It is apparently driven by his or his groups interpretation of vedic texts.

Lepper is heavy on the ad hominem, (not to mention the familiarly contemptuous tone of threatened consensus), but also disappointingly thin as a persuasive refutation of Cremo's evidence. This makes me think that charging Cremo with being ‘ideologically motivated’ is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. There’s not very much of substance amidst all the invective and charges of 'ignorance' and 'absurdity' to respond to here. Lepper’s bias is clear when he writes:“The authors are critical of archaeologists for rejecting the very early radiometric dates for technologically recent stone artifacts at Hueyatlaco, Mexico (pp. 91-93), but they are as quick to reject radiometric dates which do not agree with their preconceived interpretations (pp. 125, 139-140).”This is a misleading statement. According to Steen-MacIntyre, the geological evidence, let alone the radiometric dating, is ‘clear cut’ for the Mexican artifacts. The four dating methods used were much more reliable than the examples cited on pages 125 & 139-140. Cremo therefore has sound scientific reasons for rejecting this earlier radiometric data as it was collected decades before when the science was still in its infancy and prone to inaccuracy. Hardly a controversial position. Was Lepper simply mistaken here or being willfully dishonest? Either way, I think his bias is clear. In fact it leaps off the page.  ",Talks at Google,en,0.9701470136642456

This contains a range of consistently correlated data. Nothing ambiguous about it and not much that is ""odd or poorly explained"". ""In science, you don't start from your conclusion and then cherrypick evidence that might support it.""This is exactly what Cremo argues happened after Darwin's The Descent of Man of 1871, which postulated a theory for human evolution, and which paleoanthropology then set out to prove correct. After 1871, ancient hominid skeletons were placed in an evolutionary context, even if the evidence suggested otherwise. ""To assert a credible alternative, you start with why your explanation also explains the vast majority of observations and then show that your explanation does a better job with one of more classes of oddball cases that are not explained by the current ""accepted"" explanation.""If the theory is that all crows are black, does finding one white crow overturn the theory or modify it? It may not be a question of an ""alternative"", but a modification of what we already know. ""...his proposal fails to explain the vast majority of observations that point to gradual evolution of humanity by natural processes over a long period of time...""Is this really what the record points to? Have you seen the evidence? If there were as you claim, a ""gradual evolution"", then ""The Missing Link"" Holy Grail of paleoanthropology would certainly have been found by now. They've been looking in all the right places to find evidence supporting Darwin's hypothesis for almost 150 years . Since they started hunting in the 1870s, Darwin's theory has settled into a dogmatic assumption. How much longer will you give them before you start to wonder if it's the wrong theory? ",Talks at Google,en,0.983132302761078

Rather i think that a post communism strategem took place. Whereby Zbigniew Brzezinski opened up the gates of hell due to publicly telling on c-span in 2000, that the future main adversaries of USA would be EU and China. For the EU he then directed the attention and pointed out Greece, Poland and Portugal as the weakest links within the EU. So when any of those would be taken out of the equation, the EU would be in deep trouble.When you then look at the transactions of Goldman Sachs shortly afterwards, which may have been the first shark who smelled the blood or a socalled economic hitman, which is debetable as Goldman Sachs is one of the US banks with arguably the most and closest ties to US Government at that time, in any case the initiator for cheap credit to greece, while withholding that information from their side as also due to agreements between Greece and Goldman Sachs, Greece witholding the fact of that credit laon from the EU bodies.So making my point, the EU member states may have been just plain stupid not to notice what was going on, more likely, they made themselves complicit to these actions as the ties inbetween many of the EU member states and the US are strongly manipulated through many layers of several lobby organisations, by that then i would accuse my own government in germany aswell others in EU to willingly cripple greece to safe a ""friendship"" with the US, while the US used exactly that sentiment to their benifit to get rid of a possible future rival.",Talks at Google,en,0.9465932250022888

It would be the ultimate accomplishment of humanity and would allow our influence** to reach much further, much faster.Would Homo Erectus, if a species could speak for itself, be scared that it would become extinct to give way for Homo Sapiens, the most advanced species on earth? It could be argued that Homo Erectus is alot more similar to Homo Sapiens than Homo Sapiens to a computer based lifeform but I would argue that our current way of life as Homo Sapiens is so vastly different that the two steps (erectus->sapiens, and sapiens->computer) would appear similar in magnitude. I believe we should embrace it as a part of our evolutionary process.I think it is important to make the distinction between (computer based) artificial life and and artificial intelligence. Artificial life, a computer equivalent to a basic biological organism, would possess a mechanism that would make it want to ensure its self propagation and thus likely acquire resources that could negatively affect humanity/biological life as we know it.

I can imagine the scenarios Nick is envisioning, but I don't think they are terribly likely because they are so tangential to the evolutionary algorithm that is bringing them about. Why would a super intelligent entity be satisfied with making paperclips or accomplishing any singular task. Even if we find great interests in our lives, and are ultimately concerned with progress and scientific discovery, we don't just do that, and I have a hard time that the paperclip making machine would be a stable state for any self-aware entity. Once you are actually aware of yourself and the world around you enough to be a threat to humans, you presumably can reflect on your own behaviour and ascribe meaning to things. The risk is in whether it will value the things in the way we do.For instance, I think we might have to worry about the inevitable time where we may be forced to save on space and energy and move our entire biosphere into the digital simulation (very much like the matrix, but perhaps with many of them and for basically everything). All the physical matter would then be devoted to information processing. I think we are going to eventually want to do this anyway if for no other reason that preserving the history of the development of our planet beyond the lifetime of our sun. The question is whether a machine intelligence would just sort of impersonally decide to start that process early and / or take choices away from humans who may wish to self-determine in alternative ways. Some humans (and possibly even dolphins or chimps (etc.) may want to have their intelligence enhanced and others may wish to remain as they are (or they may decide to do it at a later time). My concern would be that we allow as much freedom to individuals as we safely can - but for how long can we justify this approach for the sake of efficiency?A super intelligent AI may see the distant future and the probability / utility of avoiding heat death, and either care about this or not. It may make subsequently better estimates based on improved understandings of physics and present circumstances that would cause it to make these decisions early - and we may have no rational argument against it. Whether we enter this debate with AI or not, intelligent agents of the future will be locked in successive debates about whether to enjoy the time and resources we have, or risk some or all percentage of our processing power on working out a way to survive heat death. This is a very difficult problem - it's the ultimately long term thinking question, and we don't yet know enough about physics to conclude survival of heat-death in someway.Off the cuff, making a new big-bang (perhaps with a newer and better optimized values for dark energy and certain other constants) seems a more likely possibility than somehow beating the 2nd law (which seems like the most implausible scenario I can think of practically by definition). Granted, this is a pretty crazy scenario, but we may face some kind of terrible choice - we may have to either effectively (by devoting processing resources to it) or directly (by destroying ourselves) have to cut our lives shorter in order to ensure that some form of life is able to persist beyond the heat-death of our own universe. The trouble is that we won't know for certain if the baby universe will manifest the desired results, and we'll only be able to run elaborate models of this process (and I think there's a law from Turing or Godel that places limits on how accurately we can model the new universe within our own universe).So in other words, we can decide to enjoy the time we have fully - and because of the accelerating expansion, we will face a very slow and grueling drop off in our collective and eventually individual intelligence as our universe spreads out until the point of the cessation of all cognition - OR we can devote ourselves fully to solving the heat-death problem. It seems to me that super intelligence or not, the nature of this problem makes it exceedingly difficult - it's a moral question for which the superintelligence can have no definitive answer, and cannot model the outcome with perfect accuracy. The only real hope for settling this question would be the worst scenario of all - that something about the nature of physics and our universe convincingly and definitively rules out the possibility of life in our universe surviving heat-death by any means. On the bright side, if we could do that early on, it would at least allow us to fully enjoy the time we have - but perhaps we all face our own versions of this kind of problem already.",Talks at Google,en,0.974287748336792

That is to say that the possibilities for synthetic entities are at least as great - they could be very much like us, or something else that we haven't considered possible. The way I reached this conclusion is that synthetic intelligence - in principle (an important distinction) - has the full range of tools that biological intelligence has, plus - any other new degrees of freedom that we / it can unlock by being or becoming more hardware agnostic. I mean this is is just another way to recognize the direction we are headed in from a large scale evolutionary perspective. We won't change substrates unless there are demonstrable improvements to be had. Swapping much of our biology for more robust systems with more options for subsequent improvement, maintenance, upkeep and alternate energy sources with the possibility of surviving the harsh climate of space or the ocean depths is a no brainer. The moment we figure out how to navigate this transition in a way that preserves what we care about - we are all gonna make that switch as fast as our tech of the time permits. So the AI will evolve and we will evolve, because if we make it to that point - we will be them.As for the heat death problem, merging with the vacuum of space is what we already do - that's what death is to my ear, and if you want to pull a Deepak and argue that it's not, the burden is on you to unpack the relevant physics, demonstrate it, and make a compelling argument for the possibility of consciousness existing in that state. Needless to say, if you manage to pull any of that off within the next decade or so, all the theists and new agers will be breaking down your door for speaking engagements, autographs of your book, and perhaps other favours as well best left unspecified. For the escape to another realm, we better have a way to learn about that universe and look before we leap. Similarly to the joining the vacuum merge, there's no reason to think this is physically possible. Granted, the baby universe might not be either, but at least we have one big bang that we know about, and if nature can do it - and we are a part of her, perhaps we can discover how to do it too, but it seems probable that we won't be able to join it from our outer bubble...

And I totally agree. I was just pointing to the fact and awesome power of CONVERGENT EVOLUTION. If you want to live forever and, you have the whole range of infinite possibility spreading her legs, the full range of tools (as you put it), then, I would argue, there would be but one possibility for the eternal rapture of the infinite one: and that is love. That is why the Buddhists who go to the heart of reality report that, indeed, the core of reality is emanating love, is made of love, infinite love. And oneness. The universe is a filthy, lovemaking machine. O yeah, baby! If it was otherwise, WE WOULD ALL BE IN HELL ALREADY!!!...In cosmic terms: The Bonobos outfucked the Chimpanzees. The Lord of Love, won. (You can watch this battle if you are really high!)By the power of convergent evolution, the superintelligence would share our greatest value: and that is love. No other force than love would be able to carry you literally forever. I mean, come on! Forever is a looong time! Or, to put it in other words, if love can't do it, nothing can! But it would be a higher order of love; nothing like the love we experience today. There is a reason why they call it Nirvana.And nature would make the apple (i.e., love) good to eat, or else she would not survive. It is basic Darwinian logic. And if nature wants to live forever, then forever she must make them apples good to eat.+ And why can't we leap to another universe? Answer: Because we are stuck in this one! We are on the inside of a bubble and, we can't get out! Then make a bubble in your bubble. Yes, Dr. Yahoo! That's a brainy idea! Then we will get totally blown away! Not if you fertilize the egg (i.e., baby universe) with your consciousness. If that is possible, then Egyptian mythology is reality! (Viz., the World egg.) That would be the day! But basically, why can't we just jump across into another universe, that is, if everything is connected? Or, if it isn't, we connect the two by a bridge, a wormhole.+ A compelling argument for the possibility of consciousness existing in ""that state:"" The holographic principle and the fact that information cannot be destroyed, not even in the vacuum.

Again, look up the gamergate scandal, the only sites willing to cover this are the breitbarts of the world, while a wall of silence exists in the regular gaming media, the mainstream media only echos the games media being too lazy to research for themselves, which only reinforces the narrative and corrupts places like wikipedia who use them as ""authoritative sources"", and the narrative of ""trolling"" and victimhood just continue to rule the day.The missing part of the ""trend"" is that people are more and more willing to act as victims for advantage.  Not just online but in real life.  A prominent feminist blogger resorted to making threats against herself when she couldn't find what she needed on the site she was going after, she's being prosecuted last I checked, meg lankers simmons was her name.   A lesbian waitress  famously made national news when she claimed her patrons had left a bigoted message on her tip receipt when in fact that was not true.  She got sympathy, coverage and donations, and when caught didn't give it back.  A family claimed their disfigured daughter was kicked out of a KFC, turns out they were lying about that too. They too received donations.  That is the actual trend, not one of impulsive trolling, its more of one of impulsive victimhood and a need to believe in such stories.",Talks at Google,en,0.954759955406189

Your question is very much like asking how is a beam of light created. A beam of light is not created. It exists because there is a source of light. Since, the source of light is eternal, the existence of the beam of light is eternal. It is Paramatma that illuminates the Atma. Question 2: Is it the same number? For the most part yes they remain relatively constant. However, if a soul has seriously hurt a God-realized Saint. Then God turns that soul into an inanimate object whereby it will remain in that prolonged state unable to get release. The soul will be unable to work for its release in that state. The only way this can be reversed is when the God-realized Saint feels pity for the soul and prays for its release. God has the ultimate power to turn an inanimate object into an animate object. When these souls get release and a place in God's abode - they no longer can be counted as soul but Mukta. Unless, God wishes the Mukta to again take birth in some physical realm. So that is why I am saying the number of soul at any given point in time is roughly constant ignoring the extreme cases. Question 3: Are they here from the big bang? No. Actually there are infinite big bangs. Souls move around these infinite multiverses. They attain a body based on their karmic footprint. Question 4: There is no proof of his talk? The West is not confident in the Spiritual arena because their ancestry lacks a substantial degree of men who were ""spiritually brave"" versus ""physically brave"". Consider the great many number of men in the East who went to the Himalayas - practiced Tum-mo - where they could live without food and water for days. In the East - the concept of God is very much an established fact. Because men in the East had ""realized"" God. They spoke from experience. The East is very clear about reincarnation and concepts related to the soul. The West just needs to study the great many books written by these great men of East and engage in what I call spiritual experiments to attain their states of realization. Even if their guidelines are just seen as hypothesis. The only way to disprove a hypothesis is to conduct an experiment. I would urge you to think more critically. I would be more than happy to answer any other questions you have. Yes keep asking - the only way to know the truth is to keep asking. Those who are in search of ""real"" truth will find. There are two kinds of men. One kind, the weak kind, who pretend that they are interested in finding the truth and also show no real preparedness to test those truths. They are basically hypocrites. And then there is the other kind - that seriously is interested in knowing the truth. And are prepared to test those truths with whatever effort it takes. You decide which category you want to belong to. The choice is yours.",Talks at Google,en,0.9402849078178406

This world is rubbish and great at the same time, you are not the moral authority of the world, look at the bright side! Holding onto the demons of your past will not help you get over them, you are beautiful and talented open yourself to the world. Confidence will scare every piece of trash man away, every horrible close minded person back to their ignorance. Unleash the beast inside you and you will become the predator you are chanelling through your feminism. Your stature is not your biggest weakness, change the world by changing yourself, your brain is superior to any man's brain. When you emit enough with every breath, every glance, every syllable spoken the world will feel you and you shall be queen.I love Chvrches",Talks at Google,en,0.9430875182151794

What I'm saying is occurred frequently in my country. Every superstar feel mental pain when they see comments. There is no restriction in writing bad comments and once you start to pay attention to wastes you get nothing but mental illness.

Freedom of any kind, not only freedom of speech does indeed come with a price. That price is a spectrum of many things but one of the most important is respect for others. Having the right to say whatever you want does not give you the right to abuse others in any way. People who say such horrendous and abusive things should pay the price of their actions and lose the freedom of speech, especially as they didn't even earn it in the first place. It is a gift that has been given to us by previous generations. I strongly believe there has to be consequences for actions otherwise there is no education and if there is no education there is only ignorance and ignorance leads to such abuse. If the likes of google, youtube etc etc clamped down on such things it would have a massive impact on showing people such behaviour is unacceptable. A quote comes to mind and I take this from an ethical and moral point not a religious 'evil wins when good people do nothing.' This is why what Lauren and the band have done is so important as it stands up for saying no to such abuse and more people need to do likewise. It especially needs to happen from those in power who have a responsibility to make sure freedom isn't misinterpreted as a freedom to hurt others. That is not what freedom is. They need to focus more on protecting people and worry less about losing some trolls who have no right to claim they deserve freedom of speech when they never earned it or are too ignorant to understand the consequences of such behaviour.

Chris Pratt is obviously someone who actually really knows the universe and has read the comics.  He mentioned having collected them as a kid, and obviously he didn't want any recent readings to interfere with the director's vision so he prepared in other ways that sounded really smart, and obviously worked well.  But... at the end there, he has a lot of that pure magnetism that RDJ has when he's promoting ""Iron Man"" or the ""Avengers""-- and it really just feels like he IS Tony Stark, and he really, really cares about that character and wants everyone to see him as he does.   I really can't wait to see where they go next. :) The film was great and Marvel is kicking butt and taking names.  Nice job.",Talks at Google,en,0.9908599853515624

I think all the characters were really well handled and they had enough interplay and character development and humanization to keep you interested in them and make you really care about them. The story was good and I love how they suprised me with how good of a character Groot and Rocket were gonna be. I love how human they both felt and how you could relate to some aspects of them, I honestly thought Rocket was going to be just the funny guy who fucks around and the way he was such a great character was a good suprise. And don't even get me started on the music...I really hope they make prequels for all of the characters, I would love to have a Groot and Rocket prequel with them just bounty hunters and a story of how they met because they seem to have a long history and i would love to know what made a racoon and a tree become such good friends. Great movie, 9/10, definatly one of the best superhero movies out right now and is for sure in my top 10 list of all time and top 10 list for this year. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9938596487045288

A lot of instituational investors hold either the index or a portfolio close to the index, for example 100 stocks out of the S&P500 with no stock making up more than 3% of assets. In such a world you would expect small SD of excess returns. That is a world where money managers manage their career risk first and dont want to be the best at delivering risk adjusted performance.

They're so fast to jump on the knowing joke of a given song, like the rapey vibe of Blurred Lines. But that's too obvious. Instead, he ignores that and figures out what would best fit the beat, lyrics, etc. That's what separates typical parodists (which are also funny very often) from Weird Al. He is able to tap into the consciousness of modern society and focus on the most minute details instead of going for the quick laugh. Which puts him heads above the rest.

Sadly this burnout also accrues to memories and such, which is what leads to the memory loss often reported. Due to the brain being a fairly holographic system where memories are not necessarily stored in a single synaptic set, such memories can if they are strong enough, be recovered, to a degree. The disorientation and confusion that results is due to much the same effect, at least till the brain can rebuild cognitive synaptic networks to replace those that have been burned out.Defenders of the treatment assert that it is not brain damage because there is no 'gross structural' damage. Of course there isn't, it is synaptic, but it most emphatically IS damage. It is indeed possible that damaging the synaptic networks that are causing the psychiatric condition is worth the damage to the rest of the brain. It is a judgement call. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9846315383911132

Each side of the trade values what the other is giving more than they value what they are giving, else no trade would be made. In such a free exchange, both parties gain more value than they otherwise would have without the trade. The same goes for when someone is trading their service (employment) for wages. Any such free market work is contributing value to the world in direct proportion to how much people pay for the service. Someone who bakes bread for a living is feeding people. Someone who washes dishes is keeping people healthy. All free market work is inherently noble, in that it is contributing a real value to the world.",Talks at Google,en,0.9358301162719728

Buddhists, yogi's, meditators and explorers of consciousness, have been describing altered states of consciousness (and their means of attainment) for millenia. All we're doing now is testing to see if what they say has any substance. And surprising, it turns out that it does.  The great thing about modern science (esp. in the last 20 or so years) is that we can test any sort of claim about improving human performance by looking at the correlates of high performance and noting the actual physiological and neurological indications that are directly correlated to high performance. From there, it's just a matter of learning what triggers or causal variables there are to bring about those higher states of performance (or ""flow states"") with greater consistency. That's what science does. That's what guys like Csikszentmihalyi, Dr Alan Watkins, Dr Steven Peters, Kotler and Wheal et al are doing. On the other hand, I don't see any clear justification for skepticism or doubt, since everything these researchers are talking about are essentially based on legit scientific observations and repeatability that one can verify for themselves with a little homework.",Talks at Google,en,0.9399427175521852

But personally, having read extensively on the subject of human performance and talked to people in medicine, education, sports psychology, etc, I can say, without a doubt, that the consensus is changing, and that a lot more educated people are realizing that there's more room for evolution / growth / development / enhancement / and performance in humans than we previously thought possible.""Ngati is right in saying that there is no need to believe.

Just as in the court it is innocent until proven guilty; it is scepticism until proven by sufficient evidence.2. The consensus is always behind the times because they are awaiting for sufficient evidence before making up their minds. Medicine's success comparatively speaking, is because they stop following theory driven path and start following empirical data. It is not perfect. But it is the more successful path.3. That is the false logic. This world has seen a great advance in medical science, thus it is radical world. If we believe that there is one objective truth, thus it is clear that multiple explanation to one event can only lead to larger number of false explanation than correct one.The path of science is full of radical ideas that have been disproven; it just does not get mentioned by anyone anymore. Lamarckism inheritance in genes for example. Phrenology approach to neuroscience, as another.When a radical idea turned to be true, the very weight of evidence will shift the consensus. Neuroplasticity is a great example of this. Yes, waiting for the evidence to decide is slow.

You could see his comfort zone being tested. Brendan allowed himself to be locked into the very thing he says is not the way to a pure, personal creative process. The tide turns at about 13 minutes. It becomes a whole other talk and you can watch his instinct kick in. Most likely not intentional, but amazing to watch him work through his tension, resolve after about eleven or twelve minutes and then recover to have a fantastic talk with interaction, sharing his personal visual language, his curiosity, and thought process that seemed more like who he was.",Talks at Google,en,0.993438184261322

So it was pretty disappointing to not hear about anything really new, as maybe my memory is off but I remember the first talk not only singing the praises of what you could do now but the exciting future ahead. Being able to 3D print anything. News stories have kept coming out showing how now you can print metal, circuit boards are possible, printing food is a thing but this talk really felt like that exciting future has now settled into a small business that's struggling to break out of that dot matrix era, where all the innovation seems to be happening around making the dot matrix printer faster, better looking and better at representing one font rather than moving us onto photo printers which is where the masses really started to get into printing, turning it from a specialist thing to something almost everyone had in their home.That's not to say I didn't enjoy the talk or that I don't love what makerbot are doing.

I live in Austria and here Hip Hop is not actually a genre that is represented much and I don't notice a lot of things that go on in the Hip Hop world in America, since I'm too far away and the information doesn't spread on to me. So, watching this interview, watching this man talk about his life, his record, the people he worked with, and so on, this actually gave me an amazing view into the life and way of a big artist, as Nas is, and shows me how he isn't that different from anyone of us writing lyrics, writing poetry, living what is meant to be in an 'artful' way.I, too, write myself and I just find it so inspirational to hear about all the stuff he has to say, and you can tell there is a lot on his mind, and all you're catching on the radio over here is trashy commercial music, that doesn't have that depth and sense that Hip Hip actually means to represent. Finally, what I want to point out to is that it's sad that at some places, like my home Austria, you just can't get in touch with people like Nas, who with their words can change the way of thinking of a person and can bring sympathy and understanding of some kind, and that's why to me Hip Hop is a feeling that certainly goes all around the world, but, however, still 'lives' in the United States, where you have the actual access to that culture and way of living and their representatives.",Talks at Google,en,0.9751773476600648

The big problem is to have a portable system with REALTIME DSP capabilities, with a touchscreen interface in as small form factor case that is powered up my 2 or 4 small batteries something like the receiver beltpack of these days.. Having that in mind the whole idea is getting even worse if you think and try to answer this question..""How about to control my IEM from an app using my iOS or Android smartphone?""... This is where i (my company) have been working into this the last 1 one year now, and this is the one of some most difficult situations to resolve, cause having the issue of Real-time monitoring, none of the above (iOS or Android) smartphones hardware or software is capable right now to run real-time DSP eq,dyn-comp,multiband comp,limiter etc.. without any Latency issues.

Or what DSP you need? In fact i think i could implement EQ+dynamics even on the built in DSP of the old Soundblaster Live, and that's a piece of crap compared to any modern processor, whether DSP or application-oriented.Latency has two sources. One source is the interface. On iOS, you can get low latency-ish (well urgh) audio, on Android you can not, but neither is a hardware issue. I think you can start off a hardware of Android device if you can get QNX for it, or just stay with Android and work around large parts of the Android system and have your own pathway from audio in the kernel to the processing software. You'll do away with most of this kind of latency at some point.Other source is the algorithmic latency. IIRs are gonna do just fine, and in EQ use e.g. are very little computational impact too. You really need to get this right.I think you should segment the problem space better. You want a device which speaks Bluetooth so you can control it from a handset - perhaps forget about it having its own controls and a display at first. Get a PC running Linux stand in for your DSP, get it to process audio by your algorithm, work on your algorithms, work on your mobile apps. Disregard the interface latency and care only about algorithmic latency. Then judge the performance of your algorithm (do use whatever old or weak hardware you can find for that), and chose the bare-metal hardware platform accordingly which you can control over SPI or whatever. You'll then just need a random bluetooth microcontroller with SPI and you're set. I think you want to aim to release your product fast and solve one problem instead of taking years and doing everything you can think of - you can leave that for later.AD Shark/Sigma for DSP? Maybe, but remember the classics. The Moto X still has a TMS320 in it, but these days MSP430 is also curious.",Talks at Google,en,0.9910976886749268

By acting serious,  he might seem interesting, or even convincing to young uneducated people. We must take note that this guru is targeting some of the most emotionally vulnerable people in our society, ie children.  He's pushing another ""save the world"" cult. Since we're living in the age of Scientology, I guess what I ment was ""save the planet"". Saving the world, is an age old adolescent fantasy which teenage boys go thru, and must grow out of, if they are to develop into healthy well balanced adults. If you're not aware of this, just do a little research on hero psychology. Prolonged over indulgence in adolescent fantasies, especially hero fantasies indicates stunted mental and emotional development. The most vulnerable people to this kind of ideology are sexually repressed males, for example moma boys and closet homosexuals. You'll notice these types of people are also quite vulnerable to  religions which preach saving the world. How many times do we hear of crazy evangelical christians being closet homosexuals? How about Adolf Hitler the Moma Boy? We need to stop assulting our children with this destructive ideology.

He walks around the globe, advising governments about their economic goals etc.This same establishment brought us where we are today: the point of no return regarding climate change; environmental situation in which cancer became all-pervasive human problem; crisis of moral reflecting in situation where parts of world having too many energy and resources while parts of world are plagued by scarcity of all necessities despite the intense 'globalization'...So - to cut the crap - I think Rifkin is spinning in order to prepare the public for the absurd project of publicly funding mass global scale transportation automation in order to help private sector by lowering their transportation costs. Also, his advocating of creating a grid of micro power plants at homes might just be nothing more than preparing grounds for big energy companies' transition from fossil fuel to renewable sources. They figured that soon, when fossil fuels are gone, they will want to switch to renewable energy sources and presence of micro power grids will lighten their problems of transition to new energy sources.Rifkin's talk has nothing to do with Resource Based Economy.

That's a HUGE, non-zero externality cost, which in the end will be internalized into Total Cost of Usership in the end. He could start by reading EMF risk research data by Persson.So, the question is: what remains in the Rifkin's zero marginal cost?Even excess thought (which consumes calories) is bound by non-zero marginal cost limitations.If you start thinking about it, it's quite clearly that Rifkin does not understand physics or reality, but is playing with pure ideas which cannot be implemented in a system which is bound by 2nd law of thermodynamics.",Talks at Google,en,0.9838309288024902

Ik ben het niet zo eens met de opmerkingen over Google. Wellicht dat Jeremy er meer inzicht in heeft, maar ik zou Google toch echt in de zelfde categorie plaatsen als de andere grote multinationals. Hoewel Google misschien wel inziet wat er aankomt, zit ze met hetzelfde probleem van schaalgrootte. In mijn ogen lijkt Google vooral vooruit te vluchten, om daarmee concurrentie en innovatie van anderen voor te blijven. Een ander punt in de (kennelijke) twijfel over oplossingen voor Climate Change. Frappant zijn zijn woorden over China, waar hij er achter kwam dat de Chinezen wel degelijk met deze hele materie bezig zijn, zonder dat hij het wist. Dat zelfde is ook met het omgaan met gedegradeerde landbouwgebieden. Daar hebben ze al meer dan 10 jaar ervaring mee op vrij grote schaal. Daarnaast zijn er in een aantal woestijngebieden erg goede voorbeelden van het weer bruikbaar maken van die gebieden voor landbouw. Het grote probleem voor het Westen is alleen dat dat geen 'high tech' is en daarmee interessant voor de industrie. Uit mislukte projecten uit Jordanië bleek dat het enige erg noodzakelijk was 'kennis' is. Weten wat je doet en waarom.

And I don't agree with his doubt about climate change solutions. Where he tells that he had some catchup to do when he visited China, he missed the achievements China has made in revitalising degraded agricultural areas. They have some 10 years experience on quite a large scale. And there are other examples that show that it is very good possible to make that change. The problem only is that it is not rocketscience. So no western companies are interested. The only thing needed is sticking to a good plan and giving the people the right education (and power) to maintain the changes.

The amount of political will to implement the level of infrastructure improvements required is not remotely feasible in our polarized political climate. Plus the notion of the Social Commons assumes a highly educated and entrepreneurial population. Given the appalling state of our educational system how are the majority of our people going to achieve the level of self sufficiency required to participate effectively? Moreover under a social commons system the means for truly complex goods and services and the associated wages concentrates wealth and power even further at the top leaving a culture of barter serfs gleaning the digital fields of the mega corporations. Mr. Rifkin's ideas are dangerous in the extreme and do absolutely nothing to correct the extreme social imbalance and dislocation we're seeing now. Whenever prophets speak of the shining city on the hill they never talk about how the plumbing works. We need real practical solutions for bringing dignity, self sufficiency, and security for the majority of our people.

I don't think any government would be stupid enough to allow such therapies in the first place. If they do, they would tax it to a point only very few could afford it. We would have Bitney Spears and Justin Bieber forever! Huzzah!But taking into consideration the miniscule possibility of widespread immortality, underground practices would bloom and prosper. After a while, the only way to really punish and stop criminal behavior would be execution (or stopping 'therapy' — which is, in essence, the same thing). Anybody with common sense and some regard for human rights would be leery of that. The justice system would eventually collapse. And with effective justice gone, people would take matters into their own hands.Of course this is just a possible scenario. But from what we learned of human history, it's plausible indeed.As for anarchy and scientific research; do you truly believe that?

I was very interested to hear about Google getting involved. While I have no data to back any of this up. This is all guesswork, what I've noticed about Google is that it goes after billion dollar ideas now, small stuff like say, Google Reader, pah, get rid of that. They also take much longer term views on business ideas than any other company I know of. Take the whole Google Maps and Google Earth and everything that entails, street view and so on. They started throwing huge amounts of money on that, buying up companies like Keyhole to somewhat accelerate there way into it but clearly at the time, there just was no business you could run on what they were doing. Google Earth was a toy we all played with. 10 years later and now they're the leading mapping service on the planet with everything from traffic analysis to advertising across the globe within maps and on mobile. A huge multi billion dollar business. The list goes on but I won't over elaborate for the sake of it, we all know about Googles self driving cars, plans to map the globe with hot air balloons that can carry internet to all. All of these huge business ideas all seem to have around a 10 year spin up time. So that's what interests me about them buying heavily into aging today. I'd suggest that they're looking at something that will work as a business in 10 years or sooner which really doesn't match what Aubrey is saying or what the science community in general is saying. 25 years is about the most optimistic thing I've heard to beat aging as a problem. Pushing my guess work even further, if you look at any major Google project, it's usually within the last couple of years that the rest of the business world catches on and starts trying to get into it (microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and so on throwing money at mapping around 8 years into Googles huge project). So could we be looking at seriously effective commercial products in the next 8-10 years that will we could really call age defying?

And you expect others to go along with you on this?  You say 'we' like you think that its outright improper of us to take our lives in our own direction.That is, away from the suffering that aging grips one in, and into a longer life that gives us proper time and energy to explore the world and its mysteries.

Specifically due to the miserable effects of aging.

The wording here does little to in this regard to change my perceptions. Anyway, my mind implied so many things because you made a post with very little content. No meat and potatoes. And then you give me a very patronizing ""Please, take at least few minutes and think about it."" I'm not sure how you expected me to take that. If you did not intend to insult and patronize me you perhaps would not have said that.Honestly, I wasn't that distressed by your suggestion that you were fine with your own personal aging. I exaggerated for effect in my post. Its more of a pity that you would deprive yourself of a longer life and disturbing that you would try and convince others of your way of thinking. The blind acceptance of death in our culture is a cult and I want to convert as many out of it as possible. Letting someone unchallenged preach about it anywhere is something I cannot do. I find it to be an ETHICAL IMPERATIVE to challenge such notions.""You cannot hear me as long as you are unreservedly obsessed with death of the body.

If you don't think I can convince you, if you are really so confident, you should be more forward with precisely what you are trying to say.As for being obsessed with death, you got me! I'm fairly sure (not really a scientifically testable thing, but its certainly the most safe assumption) that when I'm dead my existence is over. I find this idea Lovecraftian in its utter horror. I'd rather put it off for a long as possible. There is no and likely never will be any compelling evidence to the contrary. And aging? I'd rather not get old and weak and frail and sick. Most people would agree with me here.""Try talking to me instead of that conceited religious/spiritual image your mind made and is attempting to punish/hurt/dispel.""As I've said, I'm willing to respond to ""you"" but you have simply not made yourself truly available in what I'd argue would be an honest manner.

In fact, they avoid it. They reject it. They despise it. It's embedded into their minds since childhood. Children aren't taught by their parents, other adults or encouraged by their peers to seek knowledge. Schoolchildren do everything in their power to do as little school/knowledge related work as possible. Those that do (not because they enjoy it but because they feel an obligation) are labelled geeks, nerds, whatever and are ostracized. That continues into adulthood. How many countless hours are spent looking at the most insipid things on Facebook/the internet when that same time could be used to acquire mountains of knowledge. The masses prefer a never ending stream of selfies, pictures of food and gossip in detriment of knowledge. Knowledge makes their brain hurt. I see it in my friends. Whenever I talk about something scientific, they don't even want to hear about it. Religious people dismiss it for invalidating their beliefs. The masses might not biologically lack the potential to acquire knowledge but they are still stupid. Their psychologically and sociologically imposed limitations make them stupid.

That is, to take from the “haves” and give to the “have-nots,” only to serve corrupt government’s purposes – when in fact, the opposite is true.Russian revolutionary and propagandist Vladimir Lenin said, “A good communist finds use for everything, and nothing is more useful than a useful idiot.”Today, on a daily basis, we see media propagandists fronting for this administration and special interests.Thomas Jefferson rightly said, “If your government is big enough to give you everything you want, it is big enough to take away everything you have.”Throwing off all of the warnings that our forefathers have given, these “useful idiots” would have you overlook the corruption that is coming forth from this administration on a daily basis.

They are not all killed as you think. intellectuals exist in all independent states on earth and the US is not a safe bastion either. Look at how they treated Chomsky in the 1970s when he opposed the Vietnam war. He was detained and publicly humilated. Look at the horrors the US wrecked on its important citizens in the McCathy era. Indeed look at the way Snowden is right now having to hide in the place you think is the worst place on earth (Russia) just to escape the loving arms of your Eldorado 'liberal America'.

As to the New York Times, most of the public find it an irrelevant dinosaur of the old media. There are many alternative outlets on the internet, but Chomsky seems not to acknowledge them. I feel that he is comfortable fighting the corporate dinosaur media, but he is out of his depth as concerns the journalist internet culture, which has become talented at sniffing out complicated plots carried out by those in power. I doubt that he would feel comfortable in discussing the Bilderbergers or the members of the Bohemian Grove. He seems at home in discussing institutional tropisms and the behavior of corporate power as an abstraction, but I never hear from him in deep analysis of the individuals involved. Conspiratorial behavior only seems applicable as something medieval Italian families would involve themselves. So it is only in distant history that it seems to have credence in Chomsky's world. The world is too clever for conspiracy as it would quickly be exposed by the media. So the same media that is biased toward establishment power is very alert to criminal conspiracy. The democratic revolution of the 20th century has made conspiracy an outmoded tool of power as Chomsky would like to put it.

This is a minority view.For example, one general assumption about language - the philosophy of language, common understanding the linguistics of psychology - is that language is primarily a means of communication, and that it evolved as a means of communication.Probably that’s totally false. It seems that language evolved and is designed as a mode of creating and interpreting thought, basically.I can be used to communicate. Everything people do can be used to communicate. You communicate by your hairstyle, style of walk, everything, and yes, language can be used to communicate, but it doesn’t seem to be part of it’s design.It’s design seems to be radically different, and even seems to undermine communication.If you look carefully at the structure of language you find case after case, right at the core of language design, where there are conflicts between what would be efficient for communication, and what is efficient for the specific biological design of language.And in every case that’s known, communicative efficiency is sacrificed. It just isn’t a consideration.I think that’s a conclusion that has very wide spread significance.In order to establish it, you have to look at very technical work. It’s not the kind of thing you can explain in two minutes of exposition, but its not profound, it’s not quantum physics. A half an hour would certainly suffice, and I think it’s of pretty far-reaching consequence.Another general belief about language, again, almost a dogma in all the relevant fields — philosophy, linguistics and so on - is that the minimal meaningful elements in language, the sort of word-like things, pick out entities in the extra mental world, like a river, something a physicist could identify.That turns out to be true for animal systems, animal communication systems, the symbols that appear the actions that are carried out do apparently have a one to one correlation with mind-independent events. So some particular call of a monkey will be related to leaves fluttering, predators coming, or in a hummingbird, some hormonal change.It’s just not true of language. Linguistic elements do not have that property.Actually, this was understood by Aristotle. It was understood in the 17th and 18th centuries, interesting work on it.The entities that we construct in our communiques, discourse, expression, interpretation are largely mental -partially mental objects.There are ways in which they are modes in which we interpret phenomena, but they don’t pick out entities in the world, that a natural scientist could identify without looking into our minds.That tells us a lot about the nature of language, and about our own nature.Language is the core human property, and this was understood by Darwin, and by a long tradition before him.And it’s very different from the way it is usually conceived.I think those are among the conclusions that have pretty wise spread significance Again let me stress again, a very minority view, very few linguists would agree with this.But I think over time I suspect it will become clear.""",Talks at Google,en,0.9442241191864014

We’re going to commemorate its 800th anniversary next year, probably morn its disappearance.The core concept developed in Magna Carta was what we call presumption of innocence. And what it stated is that a free man cannot be subjected to state punishment without due process, without trial by a jury of peers.Now, free man was a very limited concept in the 13th century. Of course it excluded women, it excluded people who weren’t free, and so on.It gradually expanded over the centuries. So it’s embedded in the constitution, also with limits, the 14th Amendment, other limits.But now it’s being contractedThe Drone Campaign eliminates presumption of innocence.The way it works is, Obama and his advisers get together Tuesday morning and decide who they are going to kill that day.The concept guilty means Obama decided to murder you.That’s a regression that goes back 800 years.That’s pretty serious.And what’s more serious is it’s not discussed. The only thing that’s discussed is the killing of Americans.Are Americans a difference species?Who says you can kill other suspects?There is some talk about collateral damage; what about the people who are just standing around and get killed?Well yeah, that’s bad, but what about the people you’re aiming at?They are suspects.You haven’t shown proof of anything about them.Just somebody the government wants to kill.""",Talks at Google,en,0.905320167541504

Or does Paabo seem to be somehow inordinately intent upon presenting Neanderthal introgressions into modern genomes as trivial, both in regards as to their gross extent and their potential developmental impacts on the populations in question?I'm not sure I buy this limited-and-very-early-on-in-just-one-location ex-Africae/Neanderthal admixture scenario. For all that it's presented as the most parsimonious one in view of current genetic evidence, it still appears to be both fundamentally counterintuitive and indeed, practically self-contradictory per se.The remarks on a specifically Neanderthalic disinclination to innovate may also be rather overstated. If I recall correctly, their ancestral population split from our own majority-ancestral one somewhere between 400k and 600k pb. If anyrhing, each then evolved in a pretty comparably non-innovative state until their subsequent re-encounters from maybe 50k bp. Only from C33k bp onwards is any really marked evidence for identifiably modern modes of thought available in Eurasian populations that by then had already been sharing ranges with Neanderthals and other ""archaic"" groups of humans for in excess of 10 millennia.            ",Talks at Google,en,0.9499179124832152

In other words, could a computer program be created that understands genes and how those genes are expressed against certain environments (anything from a hunter gather environment to modern day industrial environments). For the 'virtual Neanderthal', you put in what we know about the human genome and the hunter gatherer environment with all the dangers and risks, and then you make changes to the genome to see how that organism responds. Is the gene advantages or neutral or beneficial? Seems like such a program, once established, would be invaluable as genes are discovered. And to keep it completely modern, for example, the program should be able to recognize the change to the genome, for example PKU; but when phenylalanine is taken out of the environment, the individual thrives. The program should, of course, be able to suggest, if not identify, what in the environment is causing the distress to the 'virtual individual'. Such a program would be a bigger endeavor than the sequencing of the human genome, but certainly would be worth the expense once established. I hope to meet Dr. Paabo one day. I admire how he admitted he was wrong when he said that we would never sequence the genome of the Neanderthal.

She took hormone blockers before she hit puberty followed by estrogen (female hormones) so she never went through male puberty just female secondary puberty which allowed her to basically develop into a woman - wide hips, breasts, voice and all those characteristics came naturally. Starting hormones before puberty is probably the best opportunity if you're going to transition, sadly most places it's not allowed until you're 18 and passed puberty. By then you'll have already gotten a deep voice, etc that some (but not all) trans women do. Also she was never born male. Gender is defined by what you identify as - sex is what you are born. Her sex was male, as a baby she couldn't of course identify herself and so she was assigned (gender) male at birth, but she mentally was assigned as female. That's where gender dysphoria comes in which is an actual medical condition. It's all really not that complex, once you're more educated on a topic the more you understand.

A respectable ”old school” print media outlet - such as The New York Times - would provide virtually everything he complains it lacks: the basic information, all sorts of context, op-eds presenting multifaceted analysis, editorials/opinions, photojournalism (where applicable). Even special editions.This is still doable - and done - in both print and online (UK's The Guardian also produces some terrific pieces of journalism).The main culprit for the current status of ”The News” ain't ”The News”, for once - it's the public. Who rushed towards a ”fast news” menu, with all of its shortcomings. All that most of ”The News” has done was to respond to the demand of its audience, oftentimes at its own peril. But constantly refusing to update its economic model was a fatal move.The vast majority of good journalists, those who think with their heads and don't bow to their bosses, have left the industry for good. They were replaced by drones subservient to their employers. The funny thing is that these drones are better suited to cater the needs of large swathes of the ”new public”, which has the attention span of a fruit fly.I'm not saying we should go backwards and his isn't a rant; I found the presentation to be most entertaining.

The majority of people passively accept the idea of private property in nature, with only a nominal expression of concern over monopolization of natural resources or the evils of land speculation.Social democracy has done nothing to overcome the destructive influence on human behavior of pervasive landlessness. This is not to suggest that most of us today should be living on a family farm, growing our own food and relying on self-sufficiency as Thomas Jefferson believed was the only basis for the survival of a democratic republic. Few of us own more land than that which exists under our primary residence. Fully one-third of households in the United States own no land at all, thus it is no surprise that households that live in rental housing have a much lower net worth than the two-thirds who at least own a residential property.Roughly one-half of the land area of the United States is in private hands. In terms of land area, just a handful of corporations and wealthy individuals own vast acreages of land. Two individuals each own land equal in size to the state of Delaware. But, that is not the most important measure of land monopoly in the United States. Most destructive is the concentrated holding of land value, of land in the central business districts of our major cities and suburban communities. The handful of economists who have focused on this issue as a major cause of poverty estimate (estimate because there are no accurate statistics collected or published), that 95 percent of the nation's land value is controlled by around 3 percent of the population, as well as foreign nationals and foreign corporate interests.The impact on our society is enormous. Land monopoly means that a major portion of the wealth produced is transferred from producers to non-producers (i.e.., to a rentier elite, who as a land owner produce nothing and provide no serivces in return). The easiest example to understand is the absentee land owner who leases land to the highest bidder for whatever purpose, collects the ground rent, and takes no risk as a producer or goods and services.Crime will only get worse as the power of the rentier elite expands, leaving less and less for others. What is needed is public policy changes that will address this problem, creating more opportunity for people to rise out of poverty and begin to realize the promise of social democracy. The most important change we can adopt is a change in how government raises its revenue, moving to land's rental value as THE main source of public revenue so that land is no longer hoarded or held for speculative gain.",Talks at Google,en,0.9406171441078186

Security is the primary purpose of community - the fundamental community motive. The tendency of humans to seek power and dominate needs to be managed by the spiritual mores of humanity. Any human organization can become a predator, rather than a protector.

Sure it would be nice and it IS a real phenomenon, that always blaming others thing. However, his advice works for ANYONE but not for EVERYONE (like most of those money-related motivational pieces of advice). Meaning, anyone who follows the advice can have success, so that part is true.But what happens if everyone does it? Then much of that kind of advice falls flat. In this context, there is only so much any given market can take, restaurants, bars etc (or anything else). So when you have only motivated intelligent people who never blame others and try their hardest, you STILL have about the same failure rate.So that kind of advice DOES work - in small doses. Don't try to put any such ""motivators"" in charge of a country or the world.

Now they have a diagnosis besides a wierdo. I'm finally brave enough to want to be tested and find out more. I was always told autistic people don't talk and I talk a lot but its on things that interest me..one of my bosses used to joke I can't  add 2+2 but can run and keep a register balanced on thousands of dollars. And I can't tie my shoes but I can fix things easily that ingot known as jessee fix it..lol I had a circle of friends that said you ain't right but proud of it because I often say what others think but don't say out loud.. or make observations and minor details.

You could follow the general way of the world and aspire to wealth/status and dress in $3,000 suits, or Aspire to 'Punk' or 'Goth' or 'Grunge' or 'Hipster' or any of a hundred other looks in an effort to be perceived as part of a specific social set. If Temple is anything like me she doesn't feel drawn to that pattern, and just wears whatever the hell feels right for her. I have no specific style or dress sense, I just wear what I want as long as it feels comfortable, and if people have any comments about that I can sure as hell return fire with significantly more comments and observations about their choices.You were 'Not criticizing, just wondering'. I hope that answers your question.If you need any further insight into it then look in a mirror and ask yourself why you chose to call yourself 'StudSupreme' on here.

Dress goes beyond peer groups or social sets. Manner of dress also communicates visually with shapes and color combinations. In the same way that a bull reacts to a red cloth waved in front of it, humans react to colors, intensities, combinations of colors, patterns, contrasts and shapes. This is what is so surprising about Temple Grandin's wardrobe choices. She has made a great effort to understand people and interact with them successfully at a high level of professionalism. However, her wardrobe not only contrasts with that, but acts against it.",Talks at Google,en,0.9907779693603516

Colour and its effects on people is something I know a fair amount about as I use applications of it in my daily life, so I'm fully aware that humans react to colours, patterns, contrasts and shapes. However for the vast majority it's not in the same way that a Bull reacts to red as Bulls have dichromatic vision and are therefore colour blind. They don't react to red at all as it looks more green to them, instead they react to the movement of the cloth.Temple's wardrobe choice is hers to make, and some of us react very differently to fabrics, colours, textures and visual information than others. The one huge point that you appear to be overlooking is that Temple is not neurotypical and so the rules you think apply across the board don't apply to her.She is far more than the sum of her parts, and considerably more than any uniform you wish her to wear. Her very presence on that stage and the esteem with which she is held tells us just how important a dress code is. I applaud her individuality and am glad that she can defy convention and still command respect.I really don't see why what she is wearing matters so much to you.",Talks at Google,en,0.9879170060157776

Your deep insecurities not withstanding"" You somewhat negate your own point.First of all there's no such thing as a deliberate misinterpretation. If it is deliberate that implies that I fully understood what you meant but was just intent on finding a way to make it seem like a personal attack.The last part ""Your deep insecurities not withstanding"" IS very much a personal attack. What evidence do you have of any 'deep insecurities' that you attribute to me? I said I am autistic, that doesn't mean I am insecure, in fact I am extremely far from insecure.I entered into this conversation in an attempt to give you some insight into how some people with ASDs think, thereby answering your initial question, and in doing so explain why what she wears is totally irrelevent to her status even if if it 'odd' to some people or confusing to the neurotypical.There are certain people on earth who do not conform to the expectations of others. What you are stating is that people who have to overcome certain handicaps just to be good enough to deal with ordinary people and then to excel should wear clothes befitting of their elevated status.Temple Grandin dresses how she wants to, and it doesn't impede her at all. Steve Jobs was apparently a stinky slob, and that did him no harm, he had quite an elevated status too. Sir Richard Branson, the Billionaire owner of railways, airlines and various media outlets wears the type of sweaters 'normal' people dread getting from half-blind aunties for Christmas, people think he's insane, yet that hasn't held him back. Stephen King the multi-millionaire horror author, usually wears t-shirts and a red-sox cap, he doesn't have to dress up for the pleasure of others, he's comfy as he is. None of them are less capable of doing well in the world because of what they wear or less successful because of it.Temple has worked at understanding the neurotypical, and has excelled, yet still people such as yourself have to find something to criticise.You say it makes no sense for her to wear what she does.

I've researched the Big Crunch theory before and was sort of confused when Dr. Filippenko showed the graph at the 10:15 mark.The reason I'm confused is because I am relying on the assumption that time is a just a representation of the expansion of space (spacetime), meaning if the expansion is outward then time will be moving forward and if expansion stops then time will stop. My question and/or critique is why time continues to move forward in his Big Crunch (red line/arrow) graph plot? Shouldn't the Big Crunch plot look like a unit circle from pi to pi/2 until it reaches the stopping point and then reverse from pi/2 back to pi and then repeat that cycle endlessly?Similarly at 10:35 he explains how if you could observe the Big Crunch you would see galaxies assemble and expand, then reach a stopping point, then reverse and dissemble. If I'm right about time reversing during the Big Crunch, wouldn't you not be able to witness the Big Crunch because consciousness (time-dependent neuron interactions) wouldn't be accessible, or in other words we wouldn't be able to process/reflect on what we're seeing?",Talks at Google,en,0.956774652004242

Also all fields do NOT dilate with the samerate, some fields like the  Higgs field hate to dilate, so that friction among fields can generateor consume spacetime.

A power point presentation would have been better.  I feel she should have broken down the different products and started with a list of harmful chemicals and then pickup the deodorant. People need to know the (endless list) names of these chemicals and how they present themselves in the human body. She should have emphasized alternative products to use, vinegar (yes), baking soda, castille soap, washing soda, borax, filtered water, bees wax, olive oil, the list is endless.She lacked on the informational side that the FDA and other government agencies have allowed these chemicals with out documentation, or studies that are so bogus. The fragrance and creams we use are completely not regulated. One comment she did make is the EU is banning chemicals that we continue to allow. Think about this: for decades our government has paid for studies but yet we still have massive chemicals in our food, our clothes, personal care products, our home (cleaning supplies, paper products, furniture, carpet, paint etc), baby products (OMG) and poor product labeling. So where did all money go to support these studies? As we continue to get more sick and our children born into our world, have toxic chemicals at birth, then compounded by our air, food, clothes and let's not forget the drug industry. Where is the outrage?",Talks at Google,en,0.993633270263672

That the transformation from hominid to human may in fact be marked primarily by the discovery of cooking with fire, and not, as previously thought, solely by the addition of meat and/or seafood (because of the high omega-3 fatty acid content) to our diet.2. That we can pretty much eat whatever we want, so long as we cook it ourselves. As a poor person who cooks the majority of her own food, I can vouch for this.3. ""I just don't think we're going to tackle things like climate change until people can imagine living in a different way.

Lactose tolerance is not a gene or a 'gene that got flipped'. Lactose persistence is an allele and there are several known versions. Lactose is merely the sugar and for the minority to merely tolerate this sugar does not mean the other components of foreign-species milk are tolerated relatively well ( high saturated fat, cholesterol, insulin, beta casomorphine, etc.) among adults and 2. certainly doesn't mean any human 'adapted to' (evolution is not directional milk just because some tolerate the sugar in milk beyond childhood. 3. John continues to promote the protein myth regarding beneficial ratios of essential amino acids in insects. Meanwhile, excess protein is implicated in more diseases of affluence than insufficient protein and there is no shortage of protein with sufficient food intake and variety on a vegan or fruitarian diet. 4.

On the other hand, religion doesn't provide a decent explanation, yet forbids you from thinking of a better one. I presume you're a Christian, but regardless of your religion or lack thereof, theists still have all of their work ahead of them to prove that there is constant celestial surveillance around us everywhere that watches us even in our sleep. You can make a good case for the deist god, who simply is a creator but doesn't necessarily care about what you do, but it takes a giant leap of faith to say that you're sure of judgment day.Science, as complicated as it is, often comes up with the simplest explanation to merely explain the observed evidence. Simplest in the sense that it requires the least number of assumptions, and the most reasonable ones to explain the observed evidence. There are even systematic ways of doing that where they assign different weights according to how odd or how extraordinary the explanations are. For example, a detective who might find a person dead in his room with bullets fired from 2 different guns, one is a pistol, the other is a rifle, then the best explanation is that this person was shot by 2 people, because why would 1 person hold 2 different weapons? It's possible that one person might hold a pistol and a rifle, but it's a stranger explanation and much less likely to actually happen as it is difficult and inefficient. If your question is ""What is the evidence on evolution"" then you'll need to do your own research on that, but I assure you that there's just too much evidence.Back to the topic of religion, what we have left of Jesus is historical records, and the bible which contains some historical records of him (if I'm not wrong). The written records state very clearly that Jesus was born out of a virgin. Now which explanation is SIMPLER? Were the laws of nature twisted to Virgin Mary's favor, or were the records written by liars? I can't wrap my head around the former unless you provide better evidence, but the latter seems like a much better explanation to me. Which ever religion you come from, this applies to everything supernatural that is taught in any religion including Moses being able to split the red sea, Noah being able to live for 900 years, and so on.",Talks at Google,en,0.9775846600532532

I am talking scientifically would have to consider religion as a part of the theory. Not ignore religion and beliefs. I am assuming you are thinking (in a limited way) that Christianity (as a belief) encompasses all theories. There is another theory you all scientists should consider. It is a better theory of everything. I can share it in detail later if you are interested. It requires a VERY open mind to digest. It considers these ideas :There is a single creator.There is a day of judgement by the creator.The creator does not discourage learning and writing but encourages it as a duty. (BTW. There exists a religious belief which incorporates this duty. )All science including gravity (or the lack of this concept) is explained better with congruence with observations by this theory. You need a open minded scientist to disconnect from Einstein's theories. They are closer to those of tesla in case someone is ready to digest tesla's ideas.There is a knowledge force called Hazrat GibreelThere is a negative influence allowed called Shaitan.Humans have been provided imagination and some mental capabilities or mind capabilities which are above angels and jinns. This allows them to be better than angels if they push themselves. Or worse than animals if they do not care to push themselves.Humans have been provided freedom of thought by the creator.Humans and jinns have been provided multiple books and the last book so far is the Quran as far as we know. Or as far as we have been told in writing by the creator.The last book is protected by God himself and does not need humans and jinns to protect its existence in this Universe.There are multiple universes (multiverses).Time only exists inside this universe as common humans perceive it.There is a limit on the capability of though speed of humans.There is a limit on the capability of though speed of jinns.Jinns may have a higher speed of thought than humans. Makes them more overconfident so they need to learn to be more careful before jumping to conclusions. (as compared to humans).There are a lot more which I can write and EXPLAIN. So it some smart alecs want to continue the discussion feel free to ask and discuss scientifically. I have a better theory of everything and am inviting all scientist to have an open dialogue and come up with a larger theory to encompass all observations and beliefs. Please do not come to the discussion with a limited frame of mind of separating science from religion claiming that they are separate just because you say so and believe so.I am not claiming to know everything. I am able to learn because I am just a bit humble and am ok to learn from anyone. Even those who chose to call me some expletive.To top it all off, I am according to the main stream media these days a (place expletive here) muslim.I might be able to help the people of the book (jews, christians, and muslims) along with other humans and jinns come to a common theory which shall help them live in harmony like they used to do in the golden ages of islam where learning and openmindedness was preferred and rewarded.Regards to all believers in the day of judgement.An invitation to all those who do not believe in the day of judgement by a single all powerful creator and master over all things.Khawar Nehal",Talks at Google,en,0.967864990234375

He does the math, and the odds is an extremely large number, making natural selection impossible if that were the case, so how does it work?He describes natural selection as a faulty lock code where you are rewarded for guessing at least 1 number right. Suppose you have a lock code that consists of 3 numbers. Chances you might get it right is 1 out of 1000 tries. Whereas if you hear a tick every time you get a number right, chances you might get the right number would be 1 out of 30 tries, because you only have to try 10 numbers (9 numbers including the zero) on each code, multiply the same number by 3 to get the number of tries you need for 3 codes. The same goes to the monkey bashing on a keyboard, if the computer only selects the letters the monkey types if it is right, then it will end up typing the right code. Though a computer is intelligent, and it knows what the answer is, natural selection is 'blind' to the future, hence his book's name: The Blind Watchmaker. He even has a documentary by the same name, just look it up on Youtube and you'll find it. Watch that documentary if you want to understand how natural selection can still create complex beings even though it's 'blind'. He explains it very clearly. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9697787165641784

I just sparked my mind.)I grew up in a completely secular environment and from the moment I began to care about these kinds of questions, I considered myself an agnostic (granted there was a short period where I developed an understanding of the concept, but that's irrelevant).As of now I have come to the conclusion agnosticism is a cop-out for those who don't want to or basically can't process on a personal level the definition of the concept of a ""god"" and the nature of such a being. My simplest line of reason is as follows: in order to debate the existence of a god the theist has to define the concept ""god"", before there could ever be an atheist. You can't refute the existence of something before it has been defined. Therefore all of the burden of proof is put on the theist shoulders and the atheist is completely bereaved of any burden of proof whatsoever. With that being said, I think the major issue with theists is they absolutely CANNOT argue without the aid of scripture. That is they assume (on some level inadvertently) an infallible truth derived from simple bronze age human philosophers, which they believe is the absolute word of a higher being. As an atheist all of their scripture, any scripture proclaimed to be true without any experimental predictions whatsoever, no matter the religious background, is to me complete bollocks. I cannot at the moment think of a better word to describe the uselessness of scripture. This is personally my biggest gripe with the whole debate, I cannot put into words the utter futility of the theistic side. As atheists we have come to an impasse in this metadebate where no further progress can be made until theists begin to truly understand concepts such as the strong anthropic principle and natural selection Now I'm beginning circle-jerk myself, that's basically this whole debate in a nutshell.",Talks at Google,en,0.9865227341651917

I'm a bit worried about where he's getting his information from, because @ 16-bit 44.1kHz (for playback) all of the information for perfectly recreating an an analog sound wave is already contained in the digital file. Anything else is unnecessary. Check out xiph.org. The (I believe if I'm not mistaken) founder of xiph.org Monty is VERY knowledgeable about audio (analog and digital) and in this article (http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html) he explains in great detail why 24-bit 96kHz is very silly, and how 192kHz can actually distort audio. The gist is that for playback 16-bit 48kHz is most likely the maximum bit depth and sample rate you would even want to use for perfect analog sound wave recreation, and after that it's just useless. The reason that it is extended to 48kHz is for the DAC filter fall off I believe. That part is a little bit over my head. I'm not sure how Mr. Scheps can sit there and tell people that vinyl is superior to a digital format, and suggest that 24-bit 96kHz audio is superior to 16-bit 48kHz audio when science is clearly not supporting this. If you want further information also check out the neat video that Monty proving that 16-bit 44.1kHz contains all the information needed to recreate an analog sound wave. He even uses analog oscilloscope and and analog wave generator, then directly compares them to the digital counterpart. It's extremely informative.

With that said and science aside (I've read compelling arguments on both sides) I can hear the difference in my studio and that's all that really matters to me. I don't have an ax to grind one way or the other, if it didn't sound better I'd be happy to do everything at 16 bit 44.1 KHZ, it would certainly save a ton of space and processing power.

I've actually tested 24-bit 44.1 kHz vs. 16 recently with tools and there is a difference. This is probably due to quantization artifacts when truncating to 16-bits from 24. I'm doing some tests with oscilloscopes using iZotope's MBIT+ dither algorithm (oscilloscopes can ""hear"" better than we'll ever be able to). I need to investigate more. 192 kHz does sound different, but according to oscilloscope this is because it's imparting some sort of distortion. Maybe that's incorrect. But at first glance that looks like what's going on. I'm also not bashing higher sample rates for recording/processing because I've learned recently there are some advantages, like emulating analog synths (i.e. NI's MONARK). But truthfully, if you're hearing more accurate audio when comparing 24-bit 44.1 kHz to for example 24-bit 96 kHz for PLAYBACK. You'd be the first. As far as I understand NO ONE has ever successfully demonstrated this in a research setting. Please, (sincerely) let me know if I'm mistaken or wrong. The various scientific articles I've read state that (for playback) 44.1 kHz is even above what we already need. That with what some would argue is already overkill resolution 24-bit depth (but it doesn't add any type of distortion or problems so it's just fine to use in conjunction with any audio sampling rate) is all we'll ever need (for playback). I think that's good news! When I'm done with my projects I'll be exporting @ 44.1 kHz 24-bit depth. Because that's what the experts who build the tools are telling me I should do.Seriously, watch this video:http://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtmlI'm totally not trying to diminish the art of mixing/producing (it's what I love the most!) but when it comes down to the technical details, I'm going to trust the electronics engineers, programmers, mathematicians, and psychoacoustic scientific researchers over a dude that USES the tools those experts build.

My grand parents died dirt poor but proud. My mother and father were also poor, I can remember us not having anything to eat for Christmas day and other struggles we went through, for my sixteenth birthday my present was a book of jokes my parent bought for me.Through our tough times my parents raised me as an absolute liberal, so much so that during my school career I was badly bullied for my anti government beliefs and being the smallest kid in my year there was not a day that passed at school that didnt see my beaten up.I was eventually expelled from high school for my anti apartheid views, was even arrested and smacked around by cops for being part of a illegal black gathering (The eighties were ""VERY KIND"" to me)I worked myself to my position, so did my parents, and their parents before them and I'll be very honest I cannot see the ""White Privilege"" people keep on telling me about. I'm trying to figure out where my ""White Privilege"" is and maybe I'm just blind but I really cannot see it.And the truth is, my history aside, the majority of ""White Privilege"" is a product of parents and grand parents having worked their fingers to the bone, getting up early and working till late, saving all their money, being responsible, caring enough, so that their children would have a life better than them. So to all you ungrateful ""Privileged Whites"" who bemoan your own standing in life as privileged and that of other whites as privileged I think you should stop for a second and take a VERY long hard look at what your own parents had to do, what they had to give up to give you the ""White Privilege"" you complain about. Maybe, just maybe after you look at what your parents went through so that you could have a better life you will do two things:1. Say thank you to your parents for their sacrifice and2. Stop asking why there is ""White Privilege"" and start asking why there is not ""Black Privilege"", why did so many black parents choose to spend the money for their children's education on booze and drugs, why did they not start their own businesses and work day and night to make a success of it, why did the majority of whites do the responsible thing and so many blacks did not?And lets be clear there are many blacks who made the right choices for their children, and many who have benefited unfairly from affirmative action policies yet nobody talks of their ""Black Privilege""",Talks at Google,en,0.9050372242927552

Where do you get the whole ""neo-nazi"" point from (and at this point I would like to point you to Godwins law, part of which states that Whoever in an online conversation calls somebody else in any form a NAZI, neo or otherwise, immediately looses all credibility of argument because of their very blatant and poor attempt at discrediting somebody with a baseless accusation of the worst kind)2. It would seem that your manual simply says ""keep up the most simple insults you can"", at least I hope it says that because if your manual refereed to the ""best insults"" you should return to school.3. Why do you say that whites are hypocrites for believing they have a right to live in any country they want, is it because you are racist (because that is quite a racist thing to say) and by the way there are more blacks in Europe than whites in Africa, more muslims in Europe than whites in muslim countries, more asians in Europe than whites in Asia....... So go do a fact check why dont you before you throw insults around.4. ""SA more at risk of genocide"" I agree 100% percent with you, in fact just last year Dr. Stanton from GENOCIDE WATCH came to South Africa and investigated claims of genocide and his final words to the white community of South Africa was that they should leave SA because of the high risk of a full blown genocide against whites happening at any time, currently White Afrikaner South Africans are at stage six of a genocide being committed against them.5. I would like you to tell me where this aggressive persecution is. And again I would like to point you to Godwins law and the use of Nazi's to further your argument!!!!! You know what I'm actually not bothered if you answer or not, I could'nt be bothered to read your reply because you have shown yourself to be nothing more than a racist that is white phobic...........You and I will never agree, arguing with you is like playing chess with a pigeon, never mind how good the game is the pigeon will just knock over the pieces and take a crap on the board. ",Talks at Google,en,0.940522849559784

In this, he has pathologized white solidarity and normalized, even apotheosized non-white solidarity (the basis of Political Correctness aka cultural Marxism).  Please read the rest of this to get a clear picture on what is going on:Human groups battle for supremacy. It starts with the sociological process known as categorization, or social identity, where the individual identifies with some larger group. Gordon Allport (white man with white privilege!) came up with this categorization 60 years ago, but what he didn't mention was the obvious: that these groups, especially racial ones struggle for survival. The mechanism of ingroup membership causes a negative view of outgroups, and race speaks to some of the most powerful ingroup feelings. This is the basis for 'racism'. Racism is not actually 'bad', it's normal; this is why its 'ok' for blacks to be racists, because, at least for blacks, it's a recognition of a normal part of human psychology/sociology.So here's the other part, the more controversial, though no less important aspect. Tim Wise is not white, at least not as far as I'm concerned. He is Jewish; half-Jewish, half-white to be exact. It is not in the racial interest of a white to denigrate their own people, and, the fact that Wise is a Jew (that half seems to dominate, as he went to Hebrew school as a youth) provides the missing link.Why are Jews like Wise allowed to get away with this, saying murderous things about whites and not only getting away with it, but getting paid to boot? Simple. Jews run America. If whites ran America, Wise would be killed for this. Indeed, a Jew named Leo Frank was killed by an angry white mob after his conviction for raping and murdering a 13-year old white girl 100 years ago. Whites ran the country during Leo Frank's lifetime. That also explains why blacks were lynched. And it also explains why 3000 white farmers have been murdered in South Africa since 1994, way more than Blacks killed by the KKK in the US for decades here. The takeaway message is, therefore obvious: if your ingroup, which is always race based, runs the nation, you rule. You can even oppress, even mass murder the ethnic/racial groups not in power, and history has shown this to be true over and over and over. You don't even need to be the majority, you just need power, that's it. The Jews have the advantage of looking like whites, so their power is disguisable and why whites are seriously in trouble and don't even know it. Hitler had to train Germans to recognize Jews (there was an exhibit in 1937 that showed Germans things like nose, lip, and eye differences). Jews may look white, but they DON'T THINK OF THEMSELVES AS WHITE. They make the absolute perfect fifth column. It's like that movie, They Live.So... white people, guess what our fate will be when WE become minorities in the country we created if we don't fight back? You guessed right! Oppression and murder! Sounds great doesn't it? And if you thought whites were bad to others, you haven't seen ANYTHING yet, as whites are the least racist by far; we don't form racial ingroups readily (that should be obvious, which is why we can be attacked in the first place by Wise b/c we don't seem to care, and we voted hugely for a Black man for President, a 'racist' group by nature would never do this) the only reason whites seem the most racist is because we have had the MEANS TO DOMINATE OTHERS, though slavery was practiced by everyone in the world hundreds of years ago, it's just the narrative has solely 'remembered' whites and forgotten about the Turks, the Chinese, etc. The Jews are the most vengeful and hateful people in the world, look at what they are doing to Palestinians. The commissars of the USSR were largely Jewish under Lenin and Stalin and loved mass murder. Tim Wise is giving a genocidal preview of what's to come. We wants us, our children to be shot in the head and thrown in the ditch, he just won't quite say that, because that would blow his cover, though he did brag and gloat a few months ago about our pending minority status.Hope you learned something.",Talks at Google,en,0.9422471523284912

Most people do not realize that improvement of a society, political entity or a culture is not reducible to an improvement in technology or technique, or, or because of some enforcement of a leveling of standards and a degradation of tastes down to the lowest common denominator imaginable. ""Improvement"" is not a linear concept, but an organic one, i.e., healthy growth, not a reckless forward acceleration.A political community is more like an organism than a simple aggregation of individual members or abstract notions. ""Progress"" as we commonly understand the term in our dumbed down society-absolute racial and cultural levelling, abortion on demand, the acceptance of homosexual marriage,the widespread proliferation of pornography, and the soon to be attempt to legitimize pedophilia- does not in any sense represent healthy growth; on the contrary, it is but the metastasizing of a cancerous growth in a dying body politic.The reality is that blacks are blacks and whites are white. Whites excel at some things, blacks at others. Each individual should have the right, I believe, to seek his or her level; the level which nature, race, history and culture dictate. The idea that blacks should be expected to excel in a society whose origins, culture, beliefs and folkways are distinctly European is as absurd as the expectation that a northern European would thrive and prosper in the tribal system of sub-Saharan Africa. And the idea that the races can be brought together by a bunch of alien cultural Marxist culture distorters, by creating the lowest possible cultural denominator and degrading all of the races is ridiculous and malicious.Like all cultural leveling, it can only end in disaster and societal dissolution. I despise hip hop or rap or whatever you call it is because it is uniformly ugly and non-musical. It has nothing in common with the music which my ancestors created and enjoyed, which is a manifestation of a very high culture and spirituality. That this music is not propagated by the media and instead replaced by the degrading glorification of criminality and misogyny is a sign that the media is malicious and criminal. It is the instrument of cultural genocide.African Americans should be encouraged to chuck this degrading music which Jewry profits from and to search their real African traditions, which are rather rich in song and good music, as is evinced by the ""negro spirituals"".  I detest the ""ghetto culture"" non-divine divas, NBA rapists, gangsta rappers and assorted thugs, which is largely a creation of the Jewish controlled media. It degrades the people it sucks in and perpetuates their criminality, their dependency and their corrosive effect on the greater host culture, whose own less cultured and aesthetically awakened members  adopt it, and are degraded by it. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9563334584236144

You don't sound black.My observations come by way of observation from many successes and failures of black men in my community.  I know hundreds...  First, you really just spouting boilerplate excuses to cover up for self-destruction of the black family and traditional values that moved blacks forward in the past.  This ready-made excuse that someone from 200 years ago has a direct bearing on you today is tenuous at best..  Now we all know slavery is was tragic... Horrible..  This was a great humanitarian tragedy..  We all get that.  But dude, it's 150 years latter??   Black man is now president..  Black attorney general.  Blacks marry and date white women all the time.  Blacks get equal educations as whites..   The game is now equal and blacks have to compete with hungry and driven whites, Chinese, etc..   So why aren't they competing in education?  Because they enter school with extra emotion issues due to lack of consistent family structure.  I hear about and see it everyday.  These poor kids are finished before it starts.  And that's a family and faith based issue.  Whitey can't fix that for you...The destruction of the two-parent black home and traditional black values prevents black men from competing today more than ever.  Slavery 150 year ago?  Bullshit...  Man has to a safe, consistent family to have a chance to compete... Finances and parental education are way over-rated.  My parents had nothing, and never went on fucking vacation, and never made more than $30k a year.  But they provided a safe, loving home, and general guidelines within which I was able to operate, and grow.  And we did, all five boys went to and graduated from college.  Most with advanced degrees.  Fifth generation german immigrants...   So maybe culture has something to with it as well...  Maybe even genetics.  I look at the effect of slavery as much as an emotional neurosis as much as anything, that keeps getting passed generationally, much like the trauma of an abusived child...  If a child is raped, he is very likely to abuse others, including his children...  But in the black community, no one is able to escape this rape, because of guys like you who keep blaming shortcoming on unknown people from the past, rather than addressing the issue!!!  So sad.  It's like an alchoholic that refuses to admit they have a problem, or worse, blames his job or wife or parents for whatever.  I call it Black Narcissism.  One other interesting thought.  Maybe you can explain.  If blacks are so repressed, why they have become so universally dominant in athletics?  ",Talks at Google,en,0.924490213394165

I've been close to becoming a player, then I discovered that honesty and integrity was more important and necessary for long-term life satisfaction and overall success. Ironically following those principles boosted my chances significantly of attracting women, but now I see many of them as uninteresting. I do still go to night clubs and go for one night stands, but I'm pretty open early on about my intentions. I don't consider it wrong in itself, it only becomes a problem when you attach more importance to it than long-term goals and values.

God puts his Divine Laws down for a reason even if us people do not understand it and the reasons. Sex is great and fun but does not seem to work in relationships where there is No Commitment even though us Humans love it. When we give our pearls away to another (intimacy) who is not committed to us it is a form of allowing ourselves to be open for the other person to abuse us and allow our vulnerabilites to come out in an uncommitted relationship where the person has not really invested in you. It is abuse against your own bodies and when you are rejected from your partner who has not invested in you and given your best attribute--Yourself and your entire body to the other significant other---and then you are rejected and taken for granted and no longer respected---You lose yourself and your Self-Esteem goes way down until you can recover and build yourself up again to a point where you can have a healthy self ---esteem. Try not having Sex and Try God's Principles of not Fornicating and Not Committing Adultry or Cheating which will really Allow the Relationship to Grow where you can get to know eachother without Sex and Test to See if you are really in Love and Ready for a Committed Life Long Partner. If they Leave because of No Sex--then they were not Worth Keeping and You Have Saved Yourself Trauma and You Will Know if They Really Loved You..I am sure I will get alot of Criticism for this, but I have Tested this Myself Out. God's Principles are Sovereign and even if we do not understand them---They work. God is the Same Yesterday, Today and the Future. There is a Reason for His Principles, even if we do not understand them and this one has to do with Self-Respect. Obey All of God Precepts and Principles. No Sex until Marriage. Even if you Love Sex---Stop it Now and Earn Back your Self-respect. People Treat Us the Way We Teach Them how to Treat Us. Men and Women are Looking for Others who Have Principles and Boundaries of Self-Respect Before They are Committed. Obey God's Principles and No Sex Until Committed in a Marriage. If you have engaged in Sex Before Marriage even Often--Just ask God for Help in this Area as Most of Us have had sex with our significant others and so we all need help in this area from God's Strength....Just ask God and He will eventually give you the strength to respect your body. He will Help You because it is His Precepts and He will not go against His Own Law. This is a Self-Respect Commandment and it Works. Society has changed His Laws. God is Consistent and His Laws are there for a Reason and the Reason is Self Respect and a True Love Commitment from your Significant Other who declares they Love You.

I agree with her all the way 100% that the media DOES make it as if ""everyone"" really is hooking up and sleeping around more than they really are, and I do love the way she puts emphasis on how important and healthy true, concrete, grounded relationships are to have. We'll definitely see eye to eye on that.The No.1 thing I absolutely disagree with most is where she places women in the sexual scene: she gives their sense of sex and longing for love too much credit, like most researchers do, and men's not enough. While women do seek sex with love and meaning, they still only pick and choose when they want this, which isn't really as often as we're supposed to think. And I absolutely disagree with her findings that women don't have sexual needs and that such an idea is programmed into women. Sexual needs in women is actually very real and has been since the beginning of time, before this ""programming."" I've spoken to several women in relationships who are angry or frustrated because their sexual needs aren't met by their guy and who openly tell me they're cheating with other men just for the sex. So it seems to me that Wendy is trying to make it as if women are in some way above having sexual needs in a relationship, or stronger than that, when it's not the case.And, yeah, I also did notice her covert chauvinist vibe in her lecture.

I also believe the main reason meth addicts' mental and physical health deteriorates so quickly and intensely is because they don't eat or sleep. they're not getting any nutrients and they're constantly on the verge of psychosis due to sleep deprivation. the majority of the harmful effects that are directly caused by the drug are due to the shitty chemicals they have to use to produce it. psychoactive substances have been used by people forever...some of the most influential people in history were alcohol and drug users. i think there are a lot of narcissistic drug addicts who steal and use drugs without any sense of self-awareness and a total lack of guilt despite hurting the people around them. these are the people who give drug users a bad image. a lot of people use drugs to explore their subconscious and unconscious mind. some use drugs in a spiritual manner. some use it simply for recreation - they just want to have some fun after working all week. unless you're hurting someone it's none government or law enforcement's business what you do inside your house. its a right all humans should have. theres also probably even more people who are using drugs as a way to self-medicate emotional issues...people that are hurting and need a release. these people are NOT criminals,Talks at Google,en,0.9616788029670716

I just willed away a couple of hand cramps, and I have willed pain away 1-2 other times as well. And if it's mental pain someone feels, simply call down the highest vibrations to wrap you in their healing energy, and if somehow that doesn't work, just simply take a shower and relax, and everything will feel so much better. People are too quick to prescribe drugs and other things, that's how the medical industry makes money. Although for more serious things like diseases and stuff, you should still see your doctor to get treatments to keep it from getting more serious, but it's ultimately up to you to heal yourself. Many people have recovered from ""incurable"" diseases because of their faith and the faith of their families.

If so read the next part if not ignore it.I will use myself as a example. I took a placebo ADHD medication once and I felt like it was working just fine. Latter that day I started messing with my brother (Which I normally wouldn't do medicated) and it ended with him getting a broken nose. If placebos work for you then you probably didn't need that medicine in the first place.Self healing however seems plausible. But to say hey I found a nice placebo to fix my vision so I don't need glasses today. And then go out driving is moronic.Anyways I feel like if I had to chance to just deal with ADHD instead of being medicated for it at this point I would be far less childish and far better off as a person. Since I am an adult now my childish implosive actions can have extreme consequence so I would rather not risk it.,Talks at Google,en,0.9934881925582886

There are times when medication is needed but there are times when it is not.Sometimes just understanding what is really going on in your body/mind is enough to reduce if not get rid of symptoms.Medication is far from being infallible and chronic medication often has side effects which are far more negative than the actually symptom it was treating. This I know from experience and from others who have shared their stories too. ,Talks at Google,en,0.9898295998573304

Too much competitiveness is not good either. It destroys the inner peace of mind. I also agree completely that love without action is not sustainable. That's why Bhakti yoga means devotional service (action with love and devotion), which combines both love and action. If you read Gita, you will understand that. Action without love is full of selfishness and greed (referred to as Raja guna in gita), while love without action will make people idle and often lead to bad deeds (Tama guna). The proper balance between these two extremes should be the goal of material life (Satva guna) and going beyond all these three gunas (quality) is the liberation (Moksha or Nirvana), which is the ultimate spiritual purpose of life.",Talks at Google,en,0.9663203954696656

Then you talking about false ego but you yourself fall prey to it that's why you are seeing yourself better than the speaker which is a presence of duality and function of mind not the self. Therefore you are not established in self let alone talking about consciousness. You are puffed up dumbo who want self glorification.

It would be like a very large scale perpetuum mobile. The nuclear industries dream.Well,the germans,technological and science nerd they are,tried this of course years ago - and failed. They even build a big reactor for that porpose and not just a smallscale prototype facility. Of course nothing of that was mentioned in the film.And the problem is not just the spent fuel rods,but the huge amount of contaminatedstuff that accumulates during a reactors life cycle.Whats true is that through advancements in science and technology way better reactors can now be build than the bulk of reactors that are now at their EoL. Butthe big problem is how to replace them without producing millions of tons additionalradioactive waste.  Even stockpile that stuff is huge technological problem becauseof the very longterm savety issiues. Nuclear power is clean for a short time windowif nothing bad happened to the involved facilities,but looking at the entire time spanit is a very wasteful and highly risky way to make your electricity. The entire cycle isjust so way beyond a human lifespan that that is mostly simply overlooked.Personaly im not a contra nuclear fanatic,but simply looking at the whole picture from mining the ore to waste disposal shows how it realy is: wasteful and dangerous. Just like burning up fossil fuel in immense quantities.Certainly the earth will find a balance no matter what we do,but probably we exclude ourselfes from the equation in the long run.....",Talks at Google,en,0.9225263595581056

You have jumped to Hitler pretty quickly there and like most people who make nazi comparisons it is poorly judged. I would say if you need to understand Peter Singer's philosophy I think it would probably be best if you decided to read his books. They are a series of logical arguments that may help you understand his views.They will definitely be more enlightening that a wikipedia entry.

Purely because if one were to conceive of a greatest conceivable being that does NOT exist, then it would not be the greatest conceivable being. To Anselm, the greatest conceivable being must exist.It's compelling, but problematic. The first problem is that saying that existence necessarily makes something better requires more argument than Anselm gives. A second argument, (which is weaker, but builds on the first problem), is that I can conceive of the Greatest Conceivable Cookie that exists, but that does not mean that the Greatest Conceivable Cookie actually exists.Still, it is badass that he just burst out with metaphysical arguments for fun.",Talks at Google,en,0.9428402185440063

""I imagine a real god"" is the same as ""I imagine a god"". If one tries to say the imagination is better because it actually reflects an existing entity, I want to know how that follows: I would think the reflected entity's existence isn't a quality of the imagined being. Likewise one can call out that god is too great for our imagination, at which point the intended point fails at the start: one cannot actually conceive such a being, so whatever Anselm imagined, wasn't god. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9816516637802124

Automated Quality of LifeUse automation and software with renewable sustainable energy and materials to provide a minimum comfortable quality of life for all active citizens (voting, know issues, understands how civilization works and how/why we got here) providing food, water, shelter, electricity, internet, transportation, and anything else necessary for a healthy society so that we have a ""passion-based economy"", where citizens use their precious minutes on Earth pursuing passions and maybe (but not necessarily) making money (new robot software program, new music/art, etc). A birthright of every human to escape the trap of lost time to acquire basic resources, a fate we've suffered from before caveman times to the 40 hour/week lost time until 65 if lucky today.   2. Indeterminate Life SpansUse biotech to make organs/all body parts except the brain(bladders/heart tissue done now) and relengthen telomeres to substantially prolong existence, giving active citizens the choice of how long they want to pursue their passions.  Would require a ""1 person chooses to cease to exist/1 person is born"" mentality or colonizing new planets to avoid starvation from exponential growth.""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.""Thomas Jefferson",Talks at Google,en,0.94130676984787

After I'm finished proving conclusively that you are wrong, I'm willing to edit the comment to point out that the situation has been rectified.Why didn't I remove the comment before you saw it? Because until you responded, I wasn't aware that they'd made higher resolutions available. YouTube never notified me and I didn't happen to come back to this, so I had no way of knowing; you are therefore blaming me for responding to something in state A as though it was in state B. It is in state B now, but at the time of the post in question, it was in state A. I cannot be expected to act on knowledge of an event that hasn't taken place yet, and which I have no specific reason to believe will happen.Here are the premises of your first post:It was available in HD when I accused you of idiocy, about one week ago.Therefore, in saying that it wasn't available in HD several months ago, you are an idiot.In order for that to be correct, you'd need to prove the following premises:P1: If it was available in HD about a week ago, it was also available in HD a few months ago.P2: It was available in HD about a week ago.P3: You said it wasn't available in HD a few months ago.C1: I must be correct, and you must be incorrect.P4: If you're incorrect, you're an idiot.P5: You're incorrect.C2: You are incorrect and therefore an idiot.Regarding P1, you suppose, but don't actually know, that YouTube gave me an option to play the video in HD several months ago. Premises cannot be based on supposition. Therefore, P1 is invalid.P2 is true; it was indeed available in HD about a week ago. However, P1 is invalid; since P1 must be valid in order for P2 and P3 to be relevant, P2 is irrelevant.P3 is true; I did indeed say that it wasn't available in HD a few months ago. However, this is irrelevant for the same reason as P2 (P1 is invalid).C1 is invalid because the supporting premises are all invalid or irrelevant.P4 is debatable. Even a genius can make a mistake - indeed, it's often necessary to make decisions that may well be mistaken in the process of selecting the best way to do something; yet a genius is not an idiot by any reasonable definition. You yourself have made mistakes, such as the ones I've illustrated here. The very premise of an insult is that you're better than the other person concerning what the insult describes. It would be hypocritical for you to insult someone for doing the same thing you yourself are doing and have done countless times.P5 is invalid because it assumes C1, which is also invalid.C2 is invalid because P4 is debatable and P5 is invalid.Your second post makes a statement that has already been addressed at the top of this post, and then it goes into some invalid logic.Here is your logic:I highly doubt it would take over 6 Months for the 720p to encode. I reiterate my ""You Idiot"" for you not being able to notice.Or, Too proud of your thumbs up maybe... Fool﻿Stated formally:P1: What I highly doubt is impossible.P2: You stated something that I highly doubt.C1: Your statement is impossible.P3: Your impossible statement is wrong.P4: If you're wrong, you're an idiot.C2: You're an idiot.P5: If you can't admit you're wrong because of votes, you're a fool.P6: You may be too proud of your votes to admit you're wrong.C3: You're a fool.P1 is invalid because impossible necessarily means a probability of 0, whereas highly doubt admits a probability of >0. In your own words, you don't believe it's impossible.P2 is correct, but as it relies on P1 to support C1 and P1 is invalid, it's irrelevant.C1 is unsupported by P1 and P2, and is therefore invalid.P3 relies on C1, which is invalid, making P3 invalid.P4 is invalid for the same reason that the first post's P4 is invalid (see above paragraph that begins with ""P4 is debatable"").C2 is unsupported by P3 and P4, and is therefore invalid.P5 is an opinion. I could agree with it, but it isn't necessarily true.P6 is invalid beacuse it's indeterminate. It can't be used to determine the truth of anything because it doesn't state whether or not I'm too proud.C3 is a concrete conclusion that depends on premises that are either opinions or indeterminate. You cannot arrive at ""you are"" by way of ""you may be"" because ""you are"" requires information that is not made available by ""you may be"".So far you're zero for two.

I never said that it isn't available in 720p now. Several months ago I made the statement that it wasn't. The statement was true when I made it. If you had simply stated that it was available in 720p now, I would have agreed with you 100%. The insult is why we are here.""You idiot""- Assumes there was something wrong with my post at the time I wrote it. Unless you think I can see the future, or have some way of knowing when YouTube makes higher resolutions available for old videos? (For the record, I can't see the future, and YouTube didn't notify me when 720p was made available.) See, you can't blame a person for not seeing something that wasn't in the only place they could have looked for it, at the time when they looked for it. You certainly can't use that as a basis to call that person an idiot. Even if you could, doing so would brand you a hypocrite, because you yourself have made bigger mistakes.""I highly doubt it would take over 6 Months for the 720p to encode. I reiterate my ""You Idiot"" for you not being able to notice.""- BUT THEN...""Just admit you were correct ""AT THE TIME"" and now the vid is in 720""- Let me get this straight. First, you ""highly doubt"" the video would take over 6 months to show up in 720p, but then you also want me to ""admit"" that I was correct at the time, which can only mean that you believe I was correct at the time. Let the record show that you agree that the video WAS NOT available in 720p at the time I made my original post.So, then, what was I to do? You were the first person to tell me that the video is available in 720p. In the same post, you called me an idiot. In other words, you pointed out that the video is now available in 720p, but gave me no chance to edit my post before calling me out on it. How can you hold me responsible for information I haven't been given a chance to respond to? Do you not know that I need to actually have information before I can act on it?Let's see if there are any other points to address...""I think you'll find that your whole ""Essay"" there is invalid by me asking about your post removal.""- I already answered that. To make the answer easy to find, look for the paragraphs that start with ""Why don't I remove the comment"" and ""Why didn't I remove the comment"" in my first response to you.""In your terms, when I made my statement the vid was in 720 so, I was correct and your argument is moot""- The insult presented in your argument is both invalid and hypocritical. That is why we are still here.""Secondly, After realising said video was now available in a higher rez (When I pointed it out to you) - Your only recourse would be to state your question was only valid at time, Realise the error and either remove or retract.""- You're forgetting that you called me an idiot, based on your assumption that I had missed something, which you later contradicted by saying I ought to admit that it wasn't there at the time (which was already a completely inescapable, obvious property of my original post). Several recourses are available in this case. This is the one I chose. How do you like it so far?""You sir were wrong at time of my initial statement and at this time none of what I have written is wrong.""- You think it isn't wrong to hold people accountable for not knowing about things that haven't happened, to contradict yourself, and to behave hypocritically?""Yes, I ""Highly Doubt..."" I didn't say it was impossible Nor did I imply it. As you missed this fundamental point and it is the basis of your entire argument,""- Remember when you said this? ""I highly doubt it would take over 6 Months for the 720p to encode. I reiterate my ""You Idiot"" for you not being able to notice."" You have contradicted yourself. If I'm an idiot for missing something that wasn't there, you're infinitely more of an idiot for missing your own statements.""Everything your wrote after that line is moot and has been disregarded.""- It's common for people to disregard information that hurts their case.""As for ""Keeping score"" You made SO MANY inaccurate premises in your 'explanation' it's not worth re-scoring.""- Prove that they're wrong.""Needless to say; At time of writing, I was correct and your comment was wrong""- If it's needless to say, why say it? Anyway, the statement that it is now available in 720p is correct and I agree with it. The statement that I am an ""idiot"" is a baseless, hypocritical insult.""stop trying to act big with your stupid ""Disassembling arguments"" - You're not any good at it... Because you are a fool :D""- I have disassembled your argument and supporting statements and demonstrated that they are baseless. I have also demonstrated that you are a hypocrite.

Look at Steve Vai, he became one of the best musicians of the planet just by following his passion.... he said: ""I never worked a day in my life, I had alot of challenges but I made my carrer with ZERO EFFORT, because playing the guitar was my juice, I just couldn't stop doing it"". There is a mistake about the follow or don't follow your passion debate, because we always concentrate on DOING things... you know, if you do this you will be rich, if you do that you will be poor... but is not about on what you DO but on what you THINK... It's all about of the way we think, so you can take any job you want and turn that experience in a positive way, learning as much as possible, but don't get stuck if is not your passion.. PASSION IS SOMETHING NATURAL WITHIN YOU, IT CAN'T BE BUILT, you can develop your skills, but you can't develop your passión.In my opinion, you have to notice that the world isn't the same anymore... Maybe this book is useful to this days, but soon words like carrer, college, grades, jobs and bosses with be part of the past, so my personal advice is to Follow your passión AND build up your skills as much as you can on whathever you're doing right now, so you will be so good they can't ignore you anyway :)",Talks at Google,en,0.9654239416122437

When asked ""who are you listening to"" I responded ""Peter Gabriel"".I was like 13 at the time. You were simply my favorite music.You are still my favorite music.I just wanted to let you know that your music has inspired me always.Games Without Frontiers was the first song I can rember on the radio; and that song led me to  my first CD ever. 16 Golden Greats.Since this CD you have been my favorite artist of all time.I have introced you to every different crowd I know.It does not matter the crowds I have been involved with........we all seem to love you.",Talks at Google,en,0.9375617504119872

I stopped teaching about twenty years ago, I put my energy writing a book about International  Ballroom Dancing. At the beginning, I was so busy just learning the basic figures, I did not pay attention to anything else, but after I was more comfortable to the dance, say, International Rumba, I began to interpret the passionate music, the timing, the hip movements and the postures, etc.  Every time the dancing is different to me, depending on who the partner I danced with and what my physical condition was in that evening. Did I just finish a Vienese Watlz  moments before I was invited to another dance immediately afterwards? Those are the factors of my performance in that particular evening. Anyway, I had as much as fun as Lang Lang playing his music by Beethoven. George Wu, A.I.A. 2014-3-5",Talks at Google,en,0.9771454334259032

As such, it does not stay in tune as long as, say, a folk guitar. If you play as vigorously as Jake can, you are going to want to check your tuning after each piece. If you carefully observe, he will play some quick notes while the audience is clapping. If it sounds off to his ear, he can then quickly check the tuner, tune up and be ready before anyone gets bored. So, it's more for the audience's benefit. As for having concert pitch in his head, even a beginner quickly learns the string intervals by the ""my dog has fleas"" method, so, no problem there.",Talks at Google,en,0.9908657670021056

The core tenets of Patanjali Yoga Sutras - Yama & Niyama ( Social and Individual disciplines) which is the essential purification processes for meditation. Eventually, we are what we eat and what we think, and purification of the sources of these is the first part of the evolution of man. Vedic society got this in India. Unfortunately, it has been overrun by the middle-eastern philosophies and then the colonial take-over has let to the mother civilization and culture being painted wrongly.The Hindu system codified the vegetarian system along with sustainable agriculture. Dr. Tuttle perhaps does not get this at all when he speaks about Krishna and the Cow @ 55:30 as a myth and it does appear that his understanding is pretty superficial at this point of time. There is plenty of historical, practical and even archaeological evidence to state that these are not myths (btw, myth comes from mithya - falsehood in Sanskrit). In any case, Americans and the meat eating world needs to wake up to this sordid chapter of Human history and get back on its track of evolving itself.The primary purpose of all consciousness that pervades all life and non-living things is to unite with the source consciousness. That is the integral aim of Yoga (sanskrit for union, union with the innate and immanent divine), a cornerstone of the Hindu philosophy.",Talks at Google,en,0.9110123515129088

But that is exactly the whole point and problem. None of us WANT to. But to say that we CAN'T is a lie.  We could if we wanted to, which would entail strictly living on the land and using NO fossil energy of any kind or downstream inputs. But nobody is even willing to entertain this concept or discuss it. So we're left with endless proposals all involving ""compromise"" (of the lifestyles we REFUSE to give up - even though it is very clear now that these lifestyles will kill the planet and humanity).The other outcome of these endless compromises is that like alternative energy, they won't work (solve the problem) or save the species (humanity) from extinction. Even with conservation, planting trees and making massive energy reductions, this will not change the outcome as suggested (too late now, the effects of climate change will be catastrophic leading to massive levels of starvation and the loss of the biosphere). The resulting die-off is inevitable now.It is the refusal to give up on this civilization and all its accompanying ""benefits"" that will continue to defeat any efforts at preservation (sustainability of the biosphere, for all life forms). The fault is not money, not really even ""greed"" (as I long thought), but the basic human nature that seeks comfort and pleasure (at any price, even we are aware it is killing us). Technology leveraged this ability on a massive scale (and hid the effects caused) and we are loathe to turn ""back"" to a tribal lifestyle that WAS green (yes, they consumed too - but only on limited, local, replenishable levels).That's why 40,000 generations ""survived"" (didn't go extinct - they're lifestyle was sustainable). But our ""civilization"" is a disaster and will not survive even 2000 years (or 250 years of advanced technology).These talks are interesting, but still fail to address the truth (heart) of the problem.",Talks at Google,en,0.9264461994171144

Not particularly original, as he attests, but certainly of a type thin on the ground by then. The clincher was the character, style and attitude of Johnny Rotten, he made all the difference. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9437643885612488

So I was saying that I am young enough to be young and I thought about it for the first time how old Chris Traeger and Leslie Knope are. I am just wondering if Leslie/Chris as the big name two people come off as like big wigs. ya know? Like I want to talk to Andy and April about their first (real life in all sincrerity--impression),Talks at Google,en,0.98211932182312

I think he intends hikers to take from this what they need and to advise folks who may want to transition to extreme distance hiking. (39:09) Personally, I wear a pair of Merrell flexible support  waterproof hiking boots that weight in 23 oz a pair. I prefer the waterproof because many-a-time I've slipped on a rock in a shallow stream and was glad my foot came up dry or have hiked in  the rain and my feet stayed dry - gaiters work with boots too. I simply carry one extra pair of socks and make it a point to change my socks 3x during the hike - we all stop at points along the trail - to avoid sweat build up. Also, I need the little extra support that a boot affords me. One simply needs to define one's needs for hiking and develop the most efficient method for those needs. As for Andrew making money for his trips and advice - that's fine too. This Youtube vid didn't cost me a cent, but I understand the sacrifice, time, and effort Anndrew needed to glean this degree of expertise - much like the Renaissance painters who needed a patron to support them as they created their masterpieces - Andrew too has too earn a living as he forges his skill into a hiking profession.

Carry a GPS and map/compass if you really want to be safe, or just the GPS if you can live with a small amount of risk. And the spot is known to be unreliable as a rescue device because of it's weak transmit signal, plus it requires an expensive subscription. The ResQLink is a far better device.

The reality is that you should always use the designated camping sites, they are put in place in order to protect the environment and it's surrounding. It may not be as pretty or as comfortable but it allows for plants and flowers to grow unperturbed. I think its a small price to pay. I just think that it is not something he should advocate ""as the right way"". My earlier comment was a little harsh but I work for Parks Canada and I see tourist all the time who gets tips like this on the internet and don't listen to our instructions to stay off the moss.

It makes up 96% of the whole universe which we are unable to feel, touch, smell and see.  Visible forms make up only less than 5%. I recently start understanding that there is a huge possibility that dark energy& matter IS the consciousness of the universe, which binds things together and leads expansion of the universe.  Almost like God is in charge.

You are also degrading Christ by making him seem magical.  I believe that Jesus' doctrine was sound doctrine. Christ saw the ways in which the experience of the world could be used positively for achieving the utmost result of living in it.  But you should see here that the ways are there for everyone - they exist as part of the world, part of humanity.  The experience of life which leads to an individual's salvation, or what could possibly be the same thing as the word ""enlightenment"", was something that Christ showed people.  Following him lead to salvation BECAUSE he could show you truths about the world - but those truths are part of the world with or without him.  You degrade Christ further by implying that the things he taught people to do have no effect.  How do I come to this conclusion?  If the instructions have no effect unless they have Christ behind them saying them, then they have no effect by themselves. In other words you deny sound doctrine.  If Christ tells people that eating a cheeseburger gets you to heaven, then its safe to say that even if you ate a cheeseburger before he was around then you got to heaven.  To use a weird metaphor.  He never said that he was MAKING things true, he stated truths, simply. You degrade Christ further again by implying that no one can understand his teaching fully enough to teach enlightenment or show the way to salvation in their own words.  That would make him the world's worst teacher.  You degrade him by implying that the truths he was teaching aren't real enough for people to discover for themselves and teach as they have discovered them.  That would make him magical, and his teachings not truths about the world and about people in the world - but an invention.  Christ, like modern teachers with whom I include Tolle, SHOW the way, with sound doctrine, reason, and an appeal to actual understanding that the way is already there as something to be discovered.  They do not create or INVENT a way.  To invent a way is a fable.  Reread your quote from Timothy and go more deeply into it.",Talks at Google,en,0.9455021023750304

It always seems that when people follow the christian belief, they completely abandon their sense of understanding anything else, and become incapable of recognizing other enlightened leaders, throwing out bits of scripture to somehow address any point. I think Jesus figures into our evolutionary process in a huge way, but I also recognize that humans do evolve (even if slowly) so that changing times need new messages. That doesn't mean we listen to just anyone. We use discernment to determine what feels correct, and this is a skill we need to learn, because we are not going to be saved by someone from 2,000 years ago.

As a result I was ""born again"".  This experience is very 'reasonable' to me, and is in complete 'agreement' with the Word of God, which states,'Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.'I have proven that verse to be true in every area  of my life, so I therefore proclaim my experience to be a ""correct and reasonable"" doctrine...I now KNOW that Jesus Christ is the ONLY WAY to the Father in heaven, and that only through HIM can we be saved.""This statement was extremely well received until the very last sentence.At which point the majority of people began to object loudly, and some even rose up and left the building.Their argument was led by a man who pointed out,""You just had to go and say that Jesus Christ is the Lord and the only way to Salvation. This is something that no one can see as sound doctrine because it is something that is not able to be reasoned by personal experience -- even your own!""However, the man went on to completely contradict himself by saying...""Christ, like modern teachers with whom I include Tolle, SHOW the way, with SOUND DOCTRINE, reason, and an appeal to actual understanding that the way is already there as something to be discovered. They do not create or INVENT a way. To invent a way is a fable.""What you may never understand or accept is that Jesus did not ""INVENT"" or just ""SHOW the way"".   --  Once and for all...  ""He IS the Way!""That statement alone divides the human race in two; and will continue to do so until He returns in Glory on that ""Great and terrible day.""On THAT day,               ""Every knee will bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.""                                         All WE have to do is WAIT AND SEE! Best wishes,Ken.",Talks at Google,en,0.9593857526779176

I suppose Eckhart is better in other ways.  They both go together well and perfectly in my opinion. If you listen to Eckhart, I recommend looking up Lester Levenson. :  )  It wasn't until I started listening to Lester that I really ""got it"" and was able to drop my ego at will.  But I don't think I would have found Lester if it wasn't for getting hooked on Eckhart who got me into this.  Plus Eckhart gives great methods on how to do it.  I think Eckhart is so good at it because he doesn't use ""spiritual texts"" for the most part. And if he does he explains it clearly. It seems a lot of gurus/spiritual teachers(whatever you want to call them) come across as ""cult leaders"" with their weird robes and constant quotes from books. They also look like they just got off of a psychedelic binge. haha. Another good teacher in my opinion is Mooji. Alan Watts is entertaining and good, but I don't think of him as much of a teacher as a philosopher, and entertainment won't really get you anywhere as far as progress in dropping the ego.  But remember, merely listening to these people won't get you anywhere, you have to apply the methods for yourself.  Eventually you won't need anybody else other than for motivation once in a while I suppose.  ",Talks at Google,en,0.9926377534866332

Yes, it is Eames' dream, but Fisher appears in Yusuf's dream dispite falling asleep first, possibly a dream of his own before being put under. Browning should appear in the 3rd level which he didn't.Another issue is that you go one layer up when escaping from limbo. you say that when you die, you go one level up like in the snow fortress. First, Ariande and Fisher could have happened to them because they had woken up from a kick while Mal, Cobb, and Saito were killed. Second, what if the one layer up dream was destroyed?

If that's the case, then why is it that he doesn't reach Limbo again whenever he goes to sleep? Also, another point made in the video was about how Saito honors the arrangement even though he wasn't there to witness the inception taking place. However, in the first layer of the dream, Saito tells Cobb that he will still honor the arrangement. Though, Cobb tells Saito that he will likely not remember that they even had an arrangement once he awakes from Limbo. I suppose since Cobb was the one who pulls him out of Limbo (thus triggering memories of how he knew Cobb), that is how Saito still remembers the arrangement upon waking up on the plane.",Talks at Google,en,0.9353597164154052

It incepts the idea that reality may be ""a dream""? The Matrix already did that. In this movie performing inception involves: developing drugs, buying airlines, going into war-like scenes on five different dream layers with lots of explosions and falling vans and other extreme things happening - just in order to put one idea in one man's head. Prof. Johnson implies that commercials (~10 sec long) do inception on millions of people, and yet, he can't see the contradiction here! Inception is a movie that does inception on millions of people planting this idea: inception is really hard (borderline impossible) to do! So you don't have to be alert, don't need to protect yourselves, don't have to ""militarize"" your subconscious.... That's the real purpose. First they propose it in the helicopter scene, and then, with the actual inception mission, they ""prove"" it to you - that is, convince you by turning off your rational mind with plot holes and sensory overload (something Hollywood movies do a lot).Another thing he missed was character transference. This time, not by the hero - but by Saito. Notice how many resonances this movie has with The Last Samurai. The hero is troubled, away from home (USA), wrecked with guilt and regret, has trouble sleeping (nightmares about the past that haunts him) and then Watanabe's character shows up and offers redemption in some way. The hero is initially W's adversary but later becomes recruited by him and his cause. W is powerful and confident, and his goal is to convince a very powerful but young and inexperienced man to change his mind about a decision of vast importance regarding leadership (something he has inherited). Notice that Hans Zimmer composed the music (something that vastly contributes to the ""air"") of both movies. And then prof. Johnson says that Mal being played by an actress who played Piaf in a previous movie is a coincidence? Come on...Cobb definitely regrets the inception he did on Mal - she's the one who ""doesn't regret nothing at all"", because she's certain about her (ghostly?) agenda. Character transference! Learn these two magic words, Hollywood does it all the time!(One screaming example would be Keanu Reeves: Little Buddha + Johnny Mnemonic = The Matrix. In terms of characters, of course, and only to a certain extent.)",Talks at Google,en,0.9768943190574646

So essentially the whole movie is Cobb entering limbo and back to where he started, still dreaming? Even if he dropped all the way back to level 1, there would still be a dream staging issue.The issue only seems to be resolved if he was in the real world, but I like the dreaming solution better as the author discussed.

You can look at every fine detail and eventually find a few things that seem coincidental. To me, the most important part of the movie isn't the hunt for whether the dream is real or not, but the fact that it doesn't  matter anymore. It looks like reality, it feels like reality. That's what I think of when I see Cobb break eye contact with the top to run to his kids. It means he no longer cares if it's a dream or not - he just wants to be with his kids. Hailing a bit back to the Matrix, ignorance is bliss. That one guy that betrayed everybody and ratted out to the Agents...

For example, age is a very important factor. If you're young, you'd probably benefit more in the long run from funds which seek aggressive capital growth (e.g. small and mid cap funds) than from funds which focus on IPI. Thus, you might choose not to have any retirement money in IPI until you're much closer to retirement and need to reduce risk. At the same time, it could make sense to have IPI in your non-retirement account to diversify/reduce volatility and if you plan to use the money for things before retirement.",Talks at Google,en,0.927589237689972

Simply put that room was a huge empty space that would create solid light object that people could interact with. This are just projections on the wall... I could just take out my TV, clear the space around him, buy a project and hook my PC/console to it and get the same result w/o buying 6 kinects, 5 other projectors, ceiling structure and hire a team to put the whole contraption in place. Also the games shown are just poor :(Now I mean no disrespect by what I said. Right now from what I've seen I'm convinced that this is the wrong approach towards turning your living room into a live holodeck. Among the problems presented is the fact that 1 single kinect unit isn't actually capable of correctly recording player movement at high speeds. The whole cost of this would be too impractical and the size is another problem. Also it doesn't help to show hastily put together software.I think right now VR head-sets are much cheaper and comfortable. Maybe update Kinect so it works a bit better (or provide gloves/sneakers that will help with motion tracking) and add a VR head-set so you can really go into the game world for full immersion.",Microsoft Research,en,0.994355857372284

However I feel like most of you are just looking at this as a device to play games. Forget all that (both the player and developer). Honestly most games made for this wont be fun past a single sitting of it. What IS awesome. Is that it can transform your entire room. So think of a game you are playing now. Take for example Destiny. You still play with a controller. And the main screen is directly in front of you. But you have the entire surrounding of your room the surrounding of the Destiny world. Or perhaps you aren't doing anything. And you just have it on as like a living room screen saver. I think it would be great. Im looking forward to being able to get one.

Projector technology isn't heading anywhere that could make this viable anytime soon.(or at all when you take into account the high expenses) I can see this being used for things like an arcade-like attraction in a theme-part or museum, but realistically, no one will be making content for this kind of thing due to the costs and complexity. The best gaming innovations in the near-to-mid future will be a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality implementations; That's because people CAN adapt that technology to increasingly complex and impressive uses in the near future, while keeping costs relatively low for both businesses and regular consumers.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9938050508499146

Imagine for a moment how much a setup with half a dozen HD projectors equipped with special censors will cost to instal and maintain; not even a gradual reduction in price due to efficiency of manufacturing will make that affordable for quite a while. Then there's the problem of content; if 3D-TVs haven't fully caught on yet due to lack of content, this will have the same problem magnified by 10; no one will want to make content for such a limited and complicated use besides the people who can afford to develop it in-house.

WP7's kernel was rewritten after Windows Mobile 6, which essentially means WP7 is a clean slate over WM6, and WP8's kernel was rewritten as well after WP7, which, in essence, makes WP8 only 2 years and 6 months old. It is really impressive what Microsoft has accomplished despite this OS being in its early years compared to a 7 year old iOS and a 6 year old Android.To put things into perspective, when iOS was 2.5 years old Apple had just implemented something as basic as copy/paste and MMS messaging (2009), and when Android was that age it would be yet another year and a half before Google put group messaging on Android (2012).

All swiping keyboards are predictive, that's part of the algorithm. As long as you go through the letters, it can narrow down what you are trying to type, as you go. And if there are multiple possibilities, they show up as suggestions above. For instance, I can swipe dictionary, thesaurus, tyrannosaurus, elevator, fantastic, Beelzebub, alchemy... it has figured everyone one of those out without fail. There are words that it can't get, that are not often used in texts. Like genetical, but that fails spell check for YouTube as well. But it has to be setup for every language. This wouldn't work in Spanish, German, Yiddish, etc, until those are supported, and have to be set as your language. I get it that this looks too good to be true.

Android is by far the most advanced mobile OS at the moment, with WP8 coming in second and iOS coming in a distant third place. The weird thing is, iOS is the oldest of the three (almost 8 years old), followed by a close Android (6.5 years old) and a much more recent WP8 (2.5 years old). This means that WP8 still has a lot of ground to cover, since it is only in its initial years, and that gives it fantastic perspectives of someday becoming the best mobile OS in the market.I am using WP8.1 (Developer's Preview) and so far I am astounded at the progress they have made in such a short period of time. They are planning on releasing at least two, possibly more, updates to WP8.1 this year. If Microsoft plays their cards right (and I believe Satya Nadella has the potential for that), they have everything to become the second most used mobile OS by 2016, and maybe coming close to Android.

Or you could better know your ally is at your side, literally. Then there is the sheer effects, it could essentially display and image of your living room, over your living room, and then Photoshop effects that relate to the game, like blood spatter. Or you could go for the 3D effect, and have projectiles come toward you running from the TV down the furniture and across the floor at you, and all of this is compensating for the angles of your physical area to still produce straight lines and things like that using the camera. I like it!",Microsoft Research,en,0.9917389154434204

This is how long it takes for the next frame of the image to come up since the last. 7ms aint bad at all tho lol. Soon we'll have 288hz or around that figure which will be about 4ms. The law of diminishing returns with our technology growth means that 1ms is quite a ways from now unless a new display technology altogether is developed before then.

But the whole diabetic thing is a load of shit. Diabetics already have problems with blood being able to travel to small blood vessels especially that of your eyes. when you put contacts on your eyes, it suffocates the eye even more. meaning youd have greater chance of going blind. First of all, this is a great example of how money persuades technology to go the long route with healthcare. Type 1 diabetes is a bad disease, but it is a very unnecessary one, one that can be cured simply by a transplant or helping your body rebuild the pancreas which it is fully capable of. All that is necessary is the right diet, one with fruits and vegetables, natural medicines. T1D was created by humans anyway, putting vaccines in our body that cause our immune system to attack its own beta cells. This is a great example of how technology always takes four steps backwards before taking one leap forward. People don't want to keep monitoring their diseases, people don't want more ways to see how their body is failing them.  Citizens want cures.
