Because this strategy uses the response variable for data manipulation, you must do it within a CV scheme to get a fair generalized error rate. Concretely: For each CV fold, compute the average value of the response variable for each categorical value. Replace each categorical value with its respective mean. Train the algorithm and test on the excluded CV fold. Another possible solution is to dummy all the variables (One hot encoding), train a regularized linear model on the data, then replace the original categorical values with the beta terms of the trained linear model. All of this must be done inside of the context of CV. This slightly more advanced method helps adjust for correlations between variables. ",PyData,en,0.9914596080780028

The same few voices heard over and over, the academics who create false legitimacy through papers and studies which are fed to the foot soldiers of their movement, the fake ""devs"", the ""cultural critics"", and the ""journalists"" who never check citations or the legitimacy of the basis of their views.  Why would they?  Just a quick search on youtube with the terms ""Anita Sarkeesian debunked in under a minute"" and you will find that person in their own words declaring both their ignorance of gaming and their status as a non gamer, and yet this is never mentioned by these people, like so much of the  inconvenient material which has been exposed, it is buried.  In proclaiming a new stage in gaming as pretentious art form they believe they can guide the medium by dictating what is acceptable.  Legitimacy is not important as they have achieved ideological hegemony, control in academia and the media, they control the message, and this is the result.  This talk at google is just yet a further example of their sway.Their criticisms about games, culture and society are laughable.  Citing the case of someone noticing that sometimes(very rarely) the people you are shooting at are arab?  This is Sarkeesian level cherry picking, in most cases you are shooting at aliens, space marines, Nazi's and only very occasionally arabs in games which are depicting wars in the middle east.  Outside of middle eastern war shooters, I can't remember the last time I saw a middle easterner as a villain.Do you know which group is actually most commonly shot at in games?  Men.  Men by the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.If these people really wanted equality, the would demand more women get shot in games.This probably doesn't feel right to anyone even if it is logically valid, but these people are sociological critics with blinders on, with a creationist level understanding of the human condition, so they would rather not understand why this is the case because on some level they know it is incompatible with their ideology.  From such blinkered perspectives, nothing of value can be had.  There is no integrity or substance, the people in this book, down the line there are problems too much to cover in a simple comment.  But it can be summed up with the example of Anita Sarkeesian, who is given a voice even now, when it is clear from video evidence that this person has no credibility at all.  Even if I granted that omission, her work speaks for itself as being intellectually vacuous trash which no one with a straight face could defend, especially if they actually dug up her citations.  Yet these are the people proclaiming themselves the new ""cultural critics"", aka the new arbiters of culture.  There is something very wrong with that, and because the veneer of credibility is so thin, these are the very types who have promoted censorship at every turn.  Critics who require an echo chamber are people who cannot win on their ideas alone.  This is the regressive left.  In the name of progressive politics they end up promoting the opposite. And because the starting point is always dishonesty, no valuable insights are to be had from such people.",Talks at Google,en,0.925998032093048

Anyways the sordid history behind that game and its maker has been a cancer on the gaming community because some people have made it a cause to paint a false narrative, even 1.5 years past the start of the controversy, and after this person has been discredited in a court of law, having abused the system to remove another persons right to speak for over a year while smearing their name across the press.  If the narrative is one of abuse, well there is  a story there some won't dare tell, they are too busy suppressing it even now.Its interesting to see how some are still digging their heels in as the world awakens to their narrative pushing.  Its exploding on the college campus's where professors holding the same ideology disregard the first amendment as an inconvenience, indoctrinating their students with an ideology which considers intention as more important than any truth. They write the books, the articles, and make the speeches at google, what is true no longer matters, what is a game no longer matters, because this is the true game they are playing, they believe if they control the narrative they control the way people think, and that is a dangerous mindset to have, especially when its become protected by the establishment.  Already in previous such talks, the comment section simply disappears once too many inconvenient holes in their narrative are exposed.The last year has exposed this clique of self appointed game ""critics"", and game academics for what they are.  The mistake in courting controversy was that people actually finally took a look at what was actually going on.  Any analysis this clique brings to the table is tainted, the junk science agenda studies with the accompanying media blitz of articles, the speaking tours, the ecosystem and methods of this ideological clique and its propaganda arm have been exposed.

And it would then give rise to the three year old later imagining cats doing non-cat related things, until they get more solid information on cats and their real descriptive attributes.Like the brain just stuffs cats into all kinds of different positions, dreams about cats doing things even if they've never seen the cat do those things, just so they can be that much more prepared for cats the next time they are encountered..At that point, I would imagine that familiarity with cats, even if simulated familiarity, is better than having only one experience to draw from... but since the simulated cats are imagined and do not reflect reality, we aren't consciously aware of those simulations, we just feel more familiarized with real cats than we actually are, and the brain is slowly replacing simulated knowledge and assumptions, with actual knowledge.",Talks at Google,en,0.973568856716156

People will keep chasing ""jobs"" as long as there is no alternative for survival. Producing, marketing (scientifically manipulating ""consumers"")  and peddling junk and bile which destroys both humans and this planet could hardly be called an economy. It doesnt matter what they do, if it means survival, desperate people will do it for money. That insanity is limitless and has nothing to do with well functioning economy. Most of us are no longer even producing anything, just marketing and peddling and even at that scaling down as time goes by.If rich, most of them completely economically useless, can live off capital and property gains, why would ordinary human see A JOB (renting various functions of his/her organs in order to pay the bills and survive till next month for someone else's profit and selfish prospects) as ultimate ideal and aspiration in his/her life? Work does not equal either job or income.Even as an example, basing ""new economy"" on making jobs out of ordinary social activities is pathology only a US capitalist from second half of 20th century can imagine as not insane. Economy based on providing emotions, empathy or mere politeness for money (its a job) is another pathology from same dictionary. Does he seriously imagine a plausible reality where we keep destroying lives of whole generations just because someone with money ""likes to have flowers every day, delivered by a ""smiling"" employee""?This slavish obsession with jobs is disgusting. Especially knowing that for some time now (decades), majority of employees are fully replaceable in a day with anyone from street. What kind of ""workers dignity"", that long time ago probably existed, contemporary workforce has? Why keep torturing people with insistence that job equals life? Its a lie.""We dont have to STEAL from the rich."" What? All wealth is social manifestation. What everyone gets is a matter of social agreement not an unavoidable law of nature. This is what we get from 100 years of industrial scale brainwashing.  ""Marketplace"" is a useful tool in our set of tools but its not a deity, its more like a power-saw. It has to be used very carefully and appropriately.Unfettered capitalism is indeed not a solution for ANYTHING, except if our goal is to exterminate life on Earth, quickly and painfully.

I call this idea the Jersey Shore hypothesis. ""Indeed, that is a problem. Even more considering that people are not rational in a way most like to believe. If we took an ordinary paper-shuffler who ""worked hard"" for 30 years, gave him financial security and sent him home free to do whatever he likes its very unlikely that he wont have to pass through a very rough period of adaptation. Being all of a sudden free, as much as a human being can be free, is overwhelming. Job that he did for 30 years thought him, even on organic level, not to think, not to speculate, not to (literally) raise his head from the desk, not to follow his underdeveloped passions etc. There was no time or resources for that, ever. There would be a huge discontinuity which people tend to fill with compulsive sex, drugs and violence. If such dynamic becomes a social phenomenon there indeed is a high potential for society wide decadence/self-destruction.In my opinion, bigger problem than that is inert behavior of those who have time, power and resources to preventively do something about it. Mr Kaplan is not the best example but not bad either. He himself, I believe honestly, thinks that essence of jobs as it always was and still is will protract into unforeseeable future. He intellectually sees, as many of us do, that all human activity can be broken into tasks and routines and is thus automatable. But, he then fails to see and connect that that means fundamental/tectonic changes in human world unlike ever before. He is unable to imagine world with less or no jobs. He reminds me of saying that ""for some people its easier to imagine end of the world than end of capitalism as it is today"".One ""small"" thing that comes to mind as what we can do, for start, is to make mass media switch off their constant obsession with jobs and redirect discussions from ""unemployed"" to ""incomeless"". Its not only more logical and humane but has potential to change people's view of life, present, future etc. As we were trained to obsess over jobs we too can be trained to stop it and understand that all humans live from income not jobs themselves. There must be a public discussion exploring differences of work and job. There should be a wider, more in-depth discussion about schemes like basic income instead of using every opportunity to pound cooked job numbers, celebrity gossip, sport events etc. Whole public discussion needs to be steered, gently. All that is not impossible but very hard considering ideological contamination, flourishing of implicit and explicit bribery, corruption and quite serious confusion.This process is ongoing whether we like it or not. Societies should be informed and thus prepared. We have means to do it.Its nice having constructive responses.",Talks at Google,en,0.927764058113098

Thank you for your feedback on my comment. I agree I am being hard on Google as far as snark goes, but not in terms of expectations. Speech recognition technology is only the first part of captioning to capture extemporaneous speaking. It was impressive how well the speech recognition worked with so much other potential noise in a large room and with the speaker walking around.  But, that said, transcripts need to be cleaned up to account for punctuation, misspellings or wrongly captured words. Captioning is not about the essence of what is said it is about relaying what is actually said, how it was said and it should include other sounds in the room, like laughter or other sounds in the environment that are part of the experience.I regularly caption my work videos using a combination ofCamtasia’s built in captioning tool which uses Microsoft’s speech recognition software that comes with the computer I use. After I lay down a narrated video, Camtasia will create time stamped captions which I then edit to clean up misheard words and to add punctuation. It then takes just a short amount of time to clean up the captions and it is very easy to export and upload to the captioned file to YouTube when I post videos there. I can make and post a captioned 5 minute video in which I speak off the top of my head in less than a half hour. In my situation the biggest barrier is the cost of Camtasia, around $300. A $25 headset with a microphone takes care of good audio and YouTube takes care of server space to post videos. I work for an employer that has no qualms with the time spent to do this and expects videos to be captioned cleanly and correctly.Because this particular video is about accessibility, because Google has the time, money and availability of labor to take these extra steps they should be called out. A small non-profit with limited financial and human resources could be excused for not adding captions, but then again to transcribe something by hand and then time stamp the captions in YouTube is very doable. It just takes time which most people choose not to take or they choose to use the imperfect speech recognition technology when a few extra steps could produce a more accessible end product. I do acknowledge that one big barrier is employers not giving employees the tools, resources and mandate to caption.Captions, and descriptive text for those who are visually challenged, should be provided universally. In the States this issue is getting litigated more and more as groups sue entities for not captioning. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/education/harvard-and-mit-sued-over-failing-to-caption-online-courses.html?_r=0Maybe at some point YouTube will be the focus of one of these suits.Thanks again for adding to this conversation!",Talks at Google,en,0.9937261939048768

Searle doesn't think that a computer CAN'T produce consciousness.   He just feels that we already have a mechanism (our brain) that does it.  Why don't we start there first? Consciousness probably occurred due to evolution millions of years of evolution.  We could try to make a comb conscious as well, but it would be infinitely more difficult (probably).  Also, complexity has nothing to do with it.  Consciousness might arise from a incredibly simple process that we are unaware of.   But, we are pretty confidence it occurs in the brain.

From my point of view, my observation is subjective while your observation is, to me, objective, and vise versa. To say that something can exist without an observer is, logically, unprovable. All observation must by definition be subjective. This is just one of many logical errors that Prof Searle made. Another one is the existence of ""consciousness"" as that is simply an ""effect"" or ""illusion"" produced by our brain.

This is 100% free from any sort of genuine intelligence. It's just a giant abacus.The existential threat from artificial intelligence comes from neural networks, adaptation, non-linear, general purpose non-narrow-AI etc.. IBM's Watson is step 1 of like 500 towards something we could consider intelligence I would imagine..  you can already ask it natural language questions, its neural networks have been pre programmed with up to the minute medical textbooks (this is Version 2 of Watson, the cancer specialist, not the Jeopardy contestant!) Okay, so it's LESS narrow than a chess computer.. but you can surely see that the range of knowledge these systems are capable of understanding has grown exponentially (as it will continue to do so). Eventually, more and more fields of expertise can be linked together and new creative answers might start popping out.. now THAT would be a great step toward a better intelligence. Steps after that include wants, desires, automatic creativity, day dreaming etc.But this guy is obsessed with the sort of pre-IBM Watson, non deep-learning neural-network calculators!We've moved on.. we're moving further.. we will get there!What about these IBM neural chips.. they model the human brain. They are fuzzy i nature, not perfect like an Intel processor that requires exact figures. or Quantum computing which has yet further potential if they are combined with different types of futuristic processors.Throw in computer vision, natural language understanding (microphones for ears) etc.Were moving towards more brain like structures and away from step by step clock-speed processors.We've got slices of brains that have been scanned and recreated in software - could be manipulated and then 3D printed to custom brain-chips.. etc.This guy.. total philosopher, not a computer scientist of a neurologist.

SYNTAX and SEMANTICS are essentially SAME THING. It's only a context-dependent difference, and this difference is quantitative, even if we still don't have a good enough definition of what those quantitative variables underlying them are. You must have a really ""fractured"" mind not to instantly ""get it"". And ""INTRINSIC"" is simply a void concept: nothing is intrinsic, everything (the universe and all) is obviously observer dependent, it just may be that the observer can be a ""huge entity"" that some people choose to personalize and call God.It's amazing to me that people with such a pathological disconnect between mind and intuition can get so far in life. He's incredibly smart, has a great intuition, but when exposed to some problems he simply can't CONNECT his REASON with his INTUITION. This is a MENTAL ILLNESS and we should invest in developing ways to treat it, seriously!Of course that ""the room + person + books + rule books + scratch paper"" can be self conscious. You can ask the room questions about ""itself"" and it will answer, proving that it has a model of itself, even if that model is not specifically encoded anywhere. It's just like mathematics, if you have a procedural definitions for the set of all natural numbers (ie. a definition that can be executed to generate the first and the next natural number), you ""have"" the entire set of natural numbers, even if you don't have them all written down on a piece of paper. Same way, if you have the processes for consciousness, you have consciousness, even if you can't pinpoint ""where"" in space and time exactly is. Consciousness is closer to a concept like ""prime numbers"" than to a physical thing like ""a rock"", you don't need a space and time for the concept of prime numbers to exist in, it just is.His way o ""depersonalizing"" conscious ""machines"" is akin to Hitler's way of depersonalizing Jews, and this ""mental disease"" will probably lead to similar genocides, even if the victims will not be ""human"" ...at least in the first phase, because you'll obviously get a HUGE retaliation in reply to any such stupidity, and my bet it that such a retaliation will be what will end the human race.Now, of course the Chinese room discussion is stupid: you can't have ""human-like consciousness"" with one Chinese room. You'd need a network of Chinese rooms that talk to each other and also operate under constraints that make their survival dependent on their ability to model themselves and their neighbors, in order to generate ""human-like consciousness"".",Talks at Google,en,0.9633673429489136

If evolution created consciousness in biological systems, then it probably has a positive survival benefit. If the brain, is the causal apparatus of consciousness, then being an organ mainly concerned with coordinating bodily movements in the environment, and maintaining the continuous function of internal systems in relation to external stimuli, would probably be evolved to best fit this role in the environment it evolved in. From this end, it would seem that consciousness is a phenomena created when you have a sufficiently complex combination of neurochemistry and modes of sensing/interacting with ones environment. Another component of consciousness implied by this relation  is a complex feedback loop between the organism that is the subject of the phenomena of consciousness, and it's environment where the limited processing power of the brain utilizes the computational method of Sparse Distributed Representations to fulfill it's goal of more adequately coordinating movements of the body into the future, and maintaining it's internal homeostasis.",Talks at Google,en,0.9379817247390748

True enough as a general statement, but if you simulate what the brain does, there's no way you haven't created an intelligence.  Obviously you can't feed a pizza slice to a program that simulates what the digestive system does, but that's a useless analogy here.  We don't even need to simulate everything going on in the brain -- just the key mechanisms that enable intelligence.  This is not duplicating a brain ; it's making another machine that performs the same  intelligence-enabling processes that manipulate information.  The reason it hasn't happened yet has nothing to do with inherent limitations of what we're able to do with hardware & software.  ""All"" we need is to understand the key processes in the brain that enable intelligence.  It's a great challenge to be sure, but some of the puzzle pieces have already been assembled.  Won't happen in the next decade?  Probably right.  Won't happen in the next 50 years?  Not so sure.",Talks at Google,en,0.9750465154647828

He points out that the way cocaine acts on the brain is not dependent on the substance's computation capacity, but rather on how it affects the very neurobiological processes carried out in the brain. And cocaine, as we know, does have cognitive effects. (Maybe it would be more interesting to take hallucinogenic drugs as an example, since there is a claim that they can enhance criativity.)

It's not quite the same as taking substances that alter the way neurons react to inputs, but if we're just interested in the possibility to be affected, it's enough. And if we need something more similar to hallucinogens or other drugs, we would likely find a way to simulate their effects.In any case, if one says that this ability of the brain to be affected by non-inputs is necessary for consciousness, this is a strong claim.

I think the question posed by the gentleman at 53:00 was driving to a proper point, but could be better expressed with the following:Since all living things are made up by simpler components and almost all physical matter can be simulated in a virtual environment, why is it so hard to come to the conclusion that we can simulate a human brain?  To make the statement more concrete,  we can learn how the human brain works and simulate (with sufficient resources) each individual component of the human brain (like neurons(and their subcomponents), glials, etc), effectively making a virtualized human brain.  Thus, anything a human can do, this machine could do, but about a million times faster (including being empathetic in counterargument to his example) with almost perfect recall (there could be bits in errors outside of correction) and nearly infinite scalability.  Hence, singularity.  Moreover, with this technology, it would even be possible to clone a human's brain virtually. However, this does have some interesting implications as far as the cloned, virtual brain going crazy, since it has no real ability to ""relieve"" perceived biological desires, as well as other issues.I'll stop there.",Talks at Google,en,0.962238311767578

However, my example is the rather brute force method of obtaining strong AI.  I believe there are simpler, less resource intensive models and I think Claus Emmeche succintly sums this up in ""The Garden in the Machine:"" ""All life is form. Neither actual nor possible life is determined by the matter of which it is constructed. Life is a process, and it is the form of this process, not the matter, that is the essence of life. One can therefore ignore the material and instead abstract from it the logic that governs the process, taking it out of the concrete material form of the life we know. Hence, one can thus achieve the same logic in another material 'clothing' or substratum. Life is fundamentally independent of the medium."" (pg. 18).Once we can formalize our brains' processes, we can most likely carve off a lot of superfluous function for a silicon substratum (like perhaps sleep/dreaming, for instance).In regards to us being in a simulation, have you ever heard of Roko's basilisk?

The fact that I have suffered in this universe need not dissuade me from loving it for the happiness and beauty it also contains and has gifted me with.  I act to create a better world not for reasons of enlightened 'immortal' self interest but simply because I have sufficient love for the universe and that which exists within it. It is the immortality of the universe that I love, that is my motive, not the faith in my own. I am personally enriched now, in this life, by virtue of this love at the same time as I am able to enrich that which I love. Whether I am enlightened or attain enlightenment is relevant only as a guidepost, we need not be attached to enlightenment either.The assertion here that science cannot prove that nothingness exists, and that that 'proves' that nothingness does 'not' exist, is fallacious. That said, I am not convinced that one need have a 'faith' in one's personal immortality in order to 'be enlightened', one need not be so attached to one's self. Indeed, realizing that one may in fact have only one life is if anything to me, more impetus to get it right, right now. There may well not be time later.",Talks at Google,en,0.963716208934784

We must control culture because it is propaganda, it must be our propaganda, and so the fixation isn't on equality across the board, its only in these specific areas where you think you can control the populous (for their own good of course).Beyond that its a disconnect from reality, the majority of TV viewers are women now, and so the middle aged female protagonist has become common because men have abandoned TV.  The problem is these campaigners do not look at what actually exists, they look at media where the dominant demographic is not female and presume sexism and demand equal representation regardless of the actual demographic or demand.  We've seen this most recently in video games, where dishonest arguments are used to conflate casual games with things like first person shooters to justify the smears of sexism.We need more women everywhere, they literally have to be the majority of their own interests and also 50% of all male interests, this is some how entirely logical?  Btw the college enrollment by gender at this point is 75 men for every 100 women, this is the actual context of reality which they are ignoring to say the things they are saying.The presumption of equality of outcome is simply based on nothing, 90%+ of the workers who actually build and maintain the infrastructure are of course male, the only concern is to push women into ""leadership"" based on a highly selective presumption of equality of outcome.Which probably explains that UN Women's Cyber violence report btw...",Talks at Google,en,0.9519394040107728

But you do need to be a woman, and in particular, one that faces issues of gender inequality, in order to comment on whether this is still ""a moral cause"". More importantly, to claim that this is an ""over the top feminist agenda"" and to suggest that Google silence the voice of Eileen Pollack, who is representing the many women that face these issues, can not be decided by someone who is not in that group.For example, if you are not black, you can not tell black people that racism doesn't exist and that they don't face issues of racial discrimination. If you are not gay, you can not tell homosexuals that they do not face issues of discrimination. If you are not transgender you can not tell transgender people that they also do not face discrimination. If you are not part of a particular group, it is irresponsible to claim that it isn't an issue any more because for the people within that group it is still a very real problem, whether you think so or not. So I stand by my initial question: ""Are you a woman?"". You are free to participate in the discussion, but how can you tell someone this isn't an issue any more when for that person it still is?Our job is to recognize that there are women who feel and live through this and rather than try to belittle this issue by saying this is an over the top feminist agenda, why not try to listen and support them. The fact that it is still being discussed AND being met with hostility is evidence that it is not resolved. It's true for women, and it's true for any group or individual that face discrimination.ps I am not a woman.",Talks at Google,en,0.9205927848815918

My intention with saying ""listen"" was exactly to point out that some people might talk about feminism in the context of your Tumblr example but as I alluded to in my original comment regarding women CEOs and scientists... I myself am a scientist and definitely experience first hand colleagues that are not paid equally, not given the same career opportunities, that are talked down to in meetings, that are not given the same opportunities for grants, etc,. When I think of gender inequality, I'm interested in addressing those kinds of issues. Sure some people may go on Tumblr and people can do and say whatever they want, but by listening to everyone with an open mind, it's easy to see that this is still a problem today on many important issues.The main thing is that I was not born a girl. I did not go to elementary school as a girl, high school as a girl, I did not go to university as a woman, nor grad school as woman. I have not worked as a woman and have no experiences as a woman. Therefore, even if a woman claims that she has been discriminated against because she is a woman, and I don't agree that what she says is discrimination, I have not experienced the billion memories this woman has that culminate her thinking this and this is my primary issue with people tell other people how to feel. I will never be able to understand what it is like to be a woman entirely, so the best I can do is listen and support the woman around me that I see are facing these issues. You don't have to support every ""feminist"" claim but in regards to this talk, Eileen Pollack is a scholar and a talented contributor to the New York Times. She isn't just some girl on Tumblr and is, in fact, raising many important points. You are free to support any issues you feel are important to you.

The wounds that they saw in tests on pigs ( the predecessor to ballistic gelatin) rivaled the larger and heavier rounds.  And now all soldiers could carry MANY more rounds on them than the heavier .30 caliber rounds in service at the time.  So much so that the Soviets abandoned their .30 caliber round (the 7.62x39 for the AK-47) in 1974 ( the 5.45x39)...and hence now use the AK-74 (for 1974) - an attempt to copy the round of the 5.56/.223 US round.  It was a study in particle physics...where a small object creates extensive ""damage"" as the velocity increases (if you double the mass of a ""projectile"" you double the kinetic energy...if you double the velocity....you QUADRUPLE the kinetic energy).",Talks at Google,en,0.9707688689231871

When I embarked on this journey, my husband was a little worried. He said, you know I am starting this startup in the middle of a recession, we cannot afford to be going to the health-food store and the farmer’s market. And I encouraged him to compare our bank statements between our zero-waste lifestyle and our pre-zero-waste lifestyle. And he found that we were saving 40 percent on our overall spending. This is due to the fact that:“(1) We consume way, way, way less than we did before. Today we are no longer adding things to our inventory, we are only replacing what needs to be replaced: a sneaker that has a hole in it or a T-shirt that is too small. And when we buy the replacement, we buy it secondhand, which by definition is cheaper. “(2) We buy our food in bulk. One needs to know that when you buy a food in packaging, 15 percent of the price covers the packaging, so when you buy in bulk, you make an automatic 15 percent savings.“(3) And finally we’ve replaced anything that’s disposable in our house with a reusable alternative, so that means we are no longer investing our money in things that you throw away. We’re no longer investing our money in the landfill. We are no longer basically throwing our money out the window. We’ve invested our money in things we can use over time, reuse over time, and this has translated into huge cumulative savings. Actually, those savings have even allowed us to install solar on our home, which then allows us to save even more. The zero-waste lifestyle is the gift that keeps on giving.”",Talks at Google,en,0.9835494756698608

I was like ""no, it is just my delicious tasting meal, I am a nice person, what do you want from me crazy person?"" No one eats meat because they do not respect or like animals. We eat it, because we disconnect the information. A key thought for me was ""would I go eat outside now and kill one of the chickens/cows/rabbits because I would love the taste?"" I mean I could feed myself without killing them, I would only do that if I absolutely had to. So I decided that as long as it is not neccesary, I would not harm animals (through my intentional behavior , so this means also in the restaurant/supermarket). This is a quite moral/ethical decision for me which does not involve fuzzy feelings of ""all animals are my fluffy friends"".

Plus animals do not have the capacity to have moral/ethical considerations, therefore they can not be expected to act as if they did.

The great thing about being human is we can make a choice to eat animals or not eat them. Carnivores don't have a choice. They must eat them. Omnivores like bears have a choice as well but they just eat things that are plentiful and some of it is meat. I've made a moral connection that animals want to live just like I want to live. That way I can enjoy their beauty from a distance. It's becoming clear they possess the same traits as humans. They have a language, build homes, raise their young, they get happy, sad, mad, become afraid and they probably wonder about their future. So just as I won't eat my dog I decided to cut out 5 other animals as well (cow,pig,sheep,birds and fish). There are many other reasons like climate change, health etc. Also we get everything we need from plants. Animals eat plants to live we eat animals.

I have been to Boston twice because my sister was going to MIT and when visiting it was just normal to take the T(subway) to get around and a lot of walking which I found really cool because it's not like that where I live. However, I think when you look at the time saved by taking a car if it indeed does save a significant amount of time then I wouldn't even consider any other form of transportation because the more time I have the more time I can spend with family and friends or go out and have fun instead of spending my time commuting to and from work. I will also say that I live in a suburb near Minneapolis/St. Paul and when you live in a suburb it's extremely hard to get anywhere without a car because places are more spread out and farther apart. So for a big city going car free can be a reality but not really for those living in the suburbs and I wouldn't change that because the point for me of the suburbs or you could call it country living is the idea of more space, more land, smaller communities and a closeness among everyone. Public transportation in the suburbs would take away from the extra land, scenery, and essentially everything that makes living outside a city so appealing.",Talks at Google,en,0.9936925172805786

I personally have always cycled and taken the bus (in the winter) and a lot of my friends have done the same. In kindergarden the kids learns to cycle and in school we would cycle on classtrips and i remember when we were around 11 years we were tought in school how to cycle proberly in a more trafficated area (we even got a biking certificat). Now i live in the second largest city in Denmark (Aarhus, which i know is nothing compared to LA or a lot of other cities in the US) but here there is queue on the bike lane, because so many cycle, however it is still faster to cycle than to drive in your car. One of the things that i like is that there are separat traffic lights for cyclers which means that it is more safe and that the drivers are more aware of the people cycling. The bike lane is also many times divided into two (one for those who are going staright ahead and one for those who are turning right) which again makes it more safe. They have done something similar with busses where there are lanes only used by the busses, which again makes it easier and more safe. Further more there are boxes around the city that counts how many cyclists have passed it. It is funny to see that at 8 o'clock in the morning already around 600 cyclist has passed the the same box as you.    When you are cycling there are people handing you newspapers and during election you get folders about the different candidates, so i think that the shops could also benefit from having more cyclers because they can advertise that way. Personally i use my hour of cycling to and from school everyday to clear my head, get som fresh air and new energy to start doing homework when i get home. Sorry for the long comment, but i think this is important and i think that Aarhus is doing a great job, that maybe can inspire others.",Talks at Google,en,0.973422646522522

But I think there is a danger of going too far in the other direction by using overly-sugar-coated language – replacing the word ""obsessions"" with ""enthusiasms"" for instance. There is a difference between repetitive behavior that is enriching and productive, and behavior that is distracting and counter-productive.As a parent of an autistic young adult I worry that, in the rightful interest of inclusiveness and politeness, we risk indulging unhealthy behaviors for fear offending anyone. Of course what is ""healthy"" or ""unhealthy"" is subjective but I think most people intuitively know the difference. For example, Dr. Prizant's interest in daily bike rides and rock-collecting seems like a healthy enthusiasm; but if he repeated his bike rides throughout the day to the detriment of his work or family it could be considered an unhealthy obsession. That distinction is important.In this climate of fear of offending anyone, a climate with phrases like ""trigger warnings"" and ""micro-aggressions"", I worry that we will water down discourse and – ironically, in the name of tolerance – become more intolerant and shy away from following the facts wherever they may lead us.",Talks at Google,en,0.9597976207733154

Your point is important and well-taken.  In my book, Uniquely Human, I have sections with titles such as ""When Enthusiasms Cause Trouble"", but it is hard to cover all bases in a short talk.  And for the record, as mentioned in the Google Talk and in my book, the term ""enthusiasms"" was coined by the late Clara Claiborne Park, the first parent to write a book (""The Siege"") about raising a child with autism, later followed by ""Exiting Nirvana"".  Clara is arguably one of the most important figures in the parent advocacy movement in the history of autism. Her daughter, Jessy, now in her 50s, is an accomplished artist but also is significantly impacted by her autism. Clara and her husband, David, made the choice to be creative in ""looking at the cup half-full"" despite Jessy's challenges, leading to a meaningful and engaged life for Jessy to this day. With all due respect, I do not believe that using the term ""enthusiasms"" is sugar-coating, it is ""reframing"".  It is one way to attack the over-whelming negative stigma of autism in mainstream society, that in my opinion, is a major inhibiting factor to promoting understanding, acceptance and opportunity for people with autism and their families.",Talks at Google,en,0.974363386631012

I believe that Reference to ""obsession"" is a dead end street and an external judgement. Reference to ""deep interest"" is an attempt to understand the person's perspective and opens up possibilities, even if we need to create boundaries by helping a person understand ""there's a time and a place"" (another section in my book).  2) In my book, I also discuss the difference between true OCD behaviors that are debilitating and interfering, in contrast to deep interests and enthusiasms that are emotionally regulating and engaging. The pathologizing perspective in autism has led to a ""stop that behavior"" bias that results in devaluing the person's perspective, preventing the development of trusting relationships and ultimately damaging the self-esteem of people on the spectrum (as now reported by many adults whose interests were squelched).",Talks at Google,en,0.9515491724014282

I didn't feel that you specifically were ""sugar-coating"".

There are clear economic reasons to want to encourage underrepresented demographics into the industry.Post Edit: I also want to point out a point on which the speaker differs considerably to the SJW brigade on this issue.  The SJWs insist that men and women are identical.  Acknowledging that we are not is the first step towards creating a work culture that is sensitive to the needs of women.",Talks at Google,en,0.9450746178627014

Physics found this out over a hundred years ago with the double-slit experiment. We can model atoms to a certain degree and use those analogies and metaphors to explain the workings of an atom, but, it's only useful to a certain degree. Is an atom a wave or a particle? It's a question that will never be answered, because, we don't have the language to create the pictures to understand Nature. ""I don't exist"" is hard to understand when someone believes they do exist. People still question what is the I they are referring too. It's a descriptive word used to translate ourselves using understandings we've developed through our own growth path. I doesn't really exist is the sense that you're made up of billions and billions of individual cells, working in symbiosis to create the illusion of one entity. But, the entity isn't an illusion. It actually exists, but that someone just may be not making the same connections as the person who assumes the entity exists. People like to ask for the existence of God. Show me proof! Well, proof is in the thought of the believer. Thoughts are measurable and radiate outside of the human head. We can hook people up to computers and have them think of a tree or a circle and the computer can show what that person is thinking about - to a certain degree. Well, perhaps, eventually we're going to be able to see the idea of what God is to a person. God is simply a descriptive word with several different meanings to each and every person. Does God exists? Yep, but that doesn't mean that the same God inside your head exists for everyone. Natures' imagination is far more greater than our imagination. We believe we have the model correct with mathematics though, because our theories work. Now, all the new sciences are hitting the same wall that physics did a 100 years ago.

(Genesis 1:27, 28; Leviticus 18:22; Proverbs 5:18, 19) The Bible condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and wife, whether it is homosexual or heterosexual conduct. (1 Corinthians 6:18) This includes intercourse, fondling another person’s genitals, and engaging in oral or anal sex.While the Bible disapproves of homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia. Instead, Christians are directed to “respect everyone.”—1 Peter 2:17, Good News Translation.Can a person be born homosexual?The Bible doesn’t comment directly on the biology of homosexual desires, though it acknowledges that we are all born with a tendency to go against what God commands. (Romans 7:21-25) Rather than focus on the cause of homosexual desires, however, the Bible prohibits homosexual acts.How to please God despite having same-sex urges.The Bible says: “Don’t be controlled by your body. Kill every desire for the wrong kind of sex.” (Colossians 3:5, Contemporary English Version) To kill wrong desires, which lead to wrong actions, you need to control your thinking. If you regularly fill your mind with wholesome thoughts, you can more readily dismiss wrong desires. (Philippians 4:8; James 1:14, 15) While you may struggle greatly at first, it can become easier. God promises to help you to “be made new in the force actuating your mind.”—Ephesians 4:22-24.The same struggle is faced by millions with heterosexual desires who wish to conform to the Bible’s standards. For example, those who are single with little prospect of marriage or who are married to a partner who is unable to function sexually choose to control their sexual urges despite any temptations they might face. They are able to live happily, and those with same-sex urges can do so as well if they truly want to please God.—Deuteronomy 30:19.",Talks at Google,en,0.9537031650543212

Between the two extremes, many view homosexuality as nothing more than an alternative lifestyle. “When I was in school,” says Daniel, 21, “even straight kids felt that if you had a problem with the idea of homosexuality, you were prejudiced and judgmental.” *Attitudes about homosexuality may differ from one generation to another or from one land to another. But Christians aren’t “carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching.” (Ephesians 4:14) Instead, they adhere to the Bible’s view.What is the Bible’s view of homosexuality? If you live by the Bible’s moral code, how can you respond to those who label you prejudiced, judgmental, or even homophobic? Consider the following questions and possible responses.What does the Bible say about homosexuality?The Bible makes it clear that God designed sex to be engaged in only between a male and a female and only within the arrangement of marriage. (Genesis 1:27, 28; Leviticus 18:22; Proverbs 5:18, 19) When the Bible condemns fornication, it is referring to both homosexual andheterosexual conduct. *—Galatians 5:19-21.",Talks at Google,en,0.9278361201286316

The Bible says: “Honor men of all sorts” or, as Today’s English Version renders it, “Respect everyone.” (1 Peter 2:17) Therefore, Christians are not homophobic. They show kindness to all people, including those who are gay.—Matthew 7:12.I also choose not to smoke. In fact, I find the very idea of it repugnant. But suppose you’re a smoker and you feel differently. I wouldn’t be prejudiced against you for your view, just as I’m sure you wouldn’t be prejudiced against me for my view—am I right? The same principle applies to our differing views of homosexuality.”Didn’t Jesus preach tolerance? If so, shouldn’t Christians take a permissive view of homosexuality?Jesus didn’t encourage his followers to accept any and all lifestyles. Rather, he taught that the way to salvation is open to “everyoneexercising faith in him.” (John 3:16) Exercising faith in Jesus includes conforming to God’s moral code, which forbids certain types of conduct—including homosexuality.—Romans 1:26, 27.When it comes to popular opinion, Christians have the courage to walk against the crowdIf someone says: “Homosexuals can’t change their orientation; they’re born that way.”You might reply: “The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to shun homosexual acts.”✔ Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible prohibits homosexualconduct. To make a comparison, you could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns fits of anger. (Psalm 37:8;Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair just because some may be inclined toward violence?”WHAT ABOUT BISEXUALITY?Although it can be found among both genders, it seems that bisexuality is becoming increasingly common in girls. Consider a few reasons.Attention“Boys openly admit that they think lesbians are appealing. Girls who lack self-confidence will do almost anything to make a guy like them.”—Jessica, 16.Curiosity“When you put something out there in movies, TV, and music that promotes girls kissing girls, teens will be tempted to try it—especially when they do not consider it to be wrong.”—Lisa, 26.Attraction“I met two bisexual girls at a party, and later I found out from a friend that they liked me. Eventually I started texting one of the girls, and I started developing feelings for her.”—Vicky, 13.If you want to please God, you should avoid experimenting with conduct that the Bible describes as unclean. (Ephesians 4:19;5:11) But what if you’re really drawn to both sexes? Many would urge you simply to embrace your sexuality and come out as bisexual. However, you should be aware that same-sex attractionis often nothing more than a passing phase. That’s what Lisette, 16, found. She says: “Talking to my parents about my feelings made me feel better. Also, through my biology classes in school, I learned that during the adolescent years, hormone levels can fluctuate greatly. I truly think that if more youths knew more about their bodies, they would understand that same-sex attraction can be temporary and they wouldn’t feel the pressure to be gay.”Even if your feelings are more deep-rooted than a short-lived growing pain, realize that the Bible presents you with a reachable goal: You can choose not to act on any wrong desires. *How could God tell someone who is attracted to the same sex to shun homosexuality? That sounds cruel.Such reasoning is based on the flawed notion that humans must act on their sexual impulses. The Bible dignifies humans by assuring them that they can choose not to act on their improper sexual urges if they truly want to.—Colossians 3:5.If someone says: “Even if you’re not gay, you should change your view of homosexuality.”You might reply: “Suppose I didn’t approve of gambling but you did. Would it be reasonable for you to insist that I change my view,  simply because millions of people choose to gamble?”✔ Remember this: Most people (including homosexuals) have some ethical code that causes them to deplore certain things—perhaps fraud, injustice, or war. The Bible prohibits those behaviors; it also draws the line at certain types of sexual conduct, including homosexuality.—1 Corinthians 6:9-11.The Bible is not unreasonable nor does it promote prejudice. It simply directs those with same-sex urges to do the same thing that is required of those with an opposite-sex attraction—to “flee from fornication.”—1 Corinthians 6:18.The fact is, millions of heterosexuals who wish to conform to the Bible’s standards employ self-control despite any temptations they might face. Their numbers include many who are single with little prospect of marriage and many who are married to a disabled partner who is unable to function sexually. They are able to live happily without fulfilling their sexual urges. Those with homosexual inclinations can do the same if they truly want to please God.—Deuteronomy 30:19.jw.org",Talks at Google,en,0.9622238874435424

There is no need to resurrect Sodom and Gomorrah in the world today as it's spirit is alive and well in much of modern day Christendom.

I would like to say placing names on people is not very professional in a debate on an issue.  Just because James White is against homosexuality does not mean he is, as you put it a ""homophobe.""  A homophobe (though not even really a word) implies that one is afraid of homosexuals, which James White is not. He is also not a homosexual hater.  Even pro-homosexual people who interviewed him on the Dr. Drew show recognized that.  Dr. White believes that homosexuality is a sin.  No more, no less.  I do not know all of the other people you are refering too, but I will tackle the few I do know about.  Before I do so, I would like to mention that these are irrelivant to wether homosexuality is a sin or not.  The Bible is very clear that it is a sin.  Here is a link to an article I wrote a Biblical response to if you wish to see all my biblical reasons. (http://nazareneally.com/2013/03/28/well-suited/) These other issues you have brought up are not pertaining to the main issue.However, in the instances I am aware of, let us takle those.  Josh Duggar when he was 14 did disgusting and detestable things to his sisters and other girls.  He also confessed to it, repented of it, was taken to the police to be charged for it, and has not done it since.  If a Christian repents of their sins God is faithful and just to forgive them of their sins and cleanse from all unrighteousness.  If Josh was still a pedophile today, then he should be judged and condemned.  Since he is not, but is forgiven, yes, as Christians we forgive him to.  That's what we do.  We do not encourage his sin, we do not make light of his sin, but we do forgive him.I do not know all of the Graham story, but no one in the church community condones adultary.  If that is in fact what he has done, he should submit himself to church discipline, and should have his credentials for being a minister taken away, plain and simple.  He is not qualified to be a minister at that point.I do not know about the rest, but again, they are not the main issue.  The main issue is this; is what Matthew Vines teaching true?  Is homosexuality biblically acceptable?  The Bible's answer is no, therfore, my answer is no.  Let's just say for the sake of argument David and Jonathan had an inappropriate affection for each other.  They were both under the Law of Moses, they both knew the Law of Moses, and they honored it more than their affection for each other.  They therefore viewed God and His law more highly than themselves.  I however do not believe that is what the text is showing because of how negatively the rest of the Bible talks about homosexuality.  Even Matthew Vines says that the Bible talks of homosexuality in a negative light.  Matthew 7:12 ""So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also for them for this is the Law and the Prophets.""  This verse talks about all the good we want done for us, do that for others.  This is not saying, ""If you want to have whatever you want, let everyone else whatever they want.""  We have one truth.  God's truth.  If you cannot accept the truth of Scripture, you have that right.  God gives you the right of choice.  But the wrong choice has severe consequences, which is why people like James White will stand and say homsexuality is a sin speak out because he does not want them to face the wrath of God, which is loving.  If you are in a car that will not start, and a man bashes the windows to drag you out of a car, that sounds violent and unloving.  But if you found out that the man dragged you out of a car because there was an oncoming train, you would be thankful to the man.

I honestly did not.  I also respectfully disagreed with you.  Again, I do not think name calling in this debate is very constructive, but clear articulate points.  If I were to call people who diagreed with me heterophobes, they would (1) rightly tell me it is not a word, but a name I created as a label for people who disagree with me, and (2) discredit any real arguments I may have had.  You may have some good points, but you can not articulate them without throwing out belittling names to those who disagree with you.  KKKristians I know for fact is not a word, but only a name that was created to label people you disagree with.  If we are going by the definition of homophobe from the Merriam-Webster dictionary, I am not one. As I have said before, I do not hate homosexuals.  They are people who deserve the Church's compassion and help.  I hate homosexuality because God hates homosexuality.  I want homosexuals to come to know and love Christ and follow Him.  I want homosexuals to repent of their sins so they can spend eternity in heaven with God. That is not unloving at all.  I wish we could agree on this topic, Simon, but if we can not, at least argue with tangible points and refrain from name calling.  As I said it is unprofessional.  I was not aware I played any victim card in my arguments.  I would be happy to address them if I have made any victim card remarks.  Thanks.",Talks at Google,en,0.9782222509384156

I hope threw ignorance  rather than arrogance and pride. Mr kyle no where is you position accurate against facts that are proven..In order to declassify something you need to do the research and never was it conducted. because in the DSM-1,2 AND 3 had  evidence that proved of its MENTAL ILLNESS was accurate. So factual to where gay scientists tried to use Biotechnology to prove other wise.unfortunately  The National Center for Biotechnology Information reports that the Y chromosome—which is much smaller—contains “only” 50 million base pairs, and is estimated to contain a mere 251 genes.  Educational institutions such as Baylor University, the Max Planck Institute, the Sanger Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, and others have spent countless hours and millions of research dollars analyzing these unique chromosomes.  As the data began to pour in, they allowed scientists to construct gene maps—using actual sequences from the Human Genome Project.  And yet, neither the map for the X nor the Y chromosome contains any “gay gene.”kyle tyson",Talks at Google,en,0.9618165493011476

Mattew Vines incorrectly defines Sola Scriptura.  It is not consistent with the confessional documents of Protestants, nor with the kind of definitions given by Protestants that have written on and defended Sola Scriptura, particularly in relation with Roman Catholics. See this short blog post from one professor of church history and Protestant minister : http://heidelblog.net/2015/01/sola-scriptura-%E2%89%A0-nuda-scriptura/Even a google search returns a better definition than that given by Matthew Vines, or at least it did right now.  I must therefore conclude from what I have gathered that Vines does not show a grasp of the fundamental things in even general Protestantism.As to Sola Scriptura spawning ""tens of thousands of denominations"" (8:14), that also comes from ignorance, and is actually a commonly heard (commonly corrected also) objection from Roman Catholics desiring to convert Protestants.  Roman Catholics point to the diversity of theological positions as proof that the Magisterium is needed to provide the Christian theological clarity with certainty.Vines is certainly a person that has not had to deal with objections to Sola Scriptura.",Talks at Google,en,0.9373766779899596

Maybe you can get a female podocarpus to soak up all that cytotoxic pollen that your neighbor's tree is producing? Podocarpus is used to make a chemotherapy drug for leukemia, and all parts of the plant are cytotoxic -- including the pollen -- meaning you are likely getting the side effects of chemotherapy treatment from breathing in all that podocarpus pollen (see Wikipedia).A lot of people I know nowadays seem to be getting allergies without the sneezing or itching eyes -- they just feel tired or fatigued all the time, or like they have a cold or flu for weeks at a time, that they keep catching over and over again during the year as different trees bloom and put tidal waves of pollen into the air.",Talks at Google,en,0.965470016002655

I've always seen this as a problem but regular people, even myself have no gain from pointing out said truth, depending on the situation. I don't say these things because they're either negative, or I feel said person won't handle the information accordingly, so I don't typically talk about whats bad about a situation. I leave it and try to forget about it, not a healthy way to do things, but its pretty much how I handle things if the truth is to much to be said. Issue are complicated and I try to keep things light by not talking about it. As for racial profiling, its a real issue that needs to be solved, and the simple easy things to say is we need good cops just like we need good teachers. So that's my thoughts on the matter and i'm pretty sure some one feels a different way.",Talks at Google,en,0.9939650893211364

I knew I would get you going with the oxymoron bit, but you make it too easy! However, if you reflect carefully on the statement I made in reference to being an oxymoron, I think that it makes adequate use of the definition of the term. The thing is, I don't like to spoon feed my criticism, but if you look carefully at my original comment (the one that got this whole thing going) then I think it perfectly reflects my opinion on the subject and to whom it specifically regards. The fact that you insist on continuing to prod at what I meant suggests that a) you just like to prod, or 2) you truly do not understand, and d) perhaps both. However, it is my job as a yootoob edumacator to guide the student (you) to come to his or her or its own conclusion on the matter.

For each guess you shall provide at least 350 words to back up your hypothesis and present your findings in a precise, cohesive manner. Your grading scale will consist of ""meh"" to ""bleh""--I don't think that needs further explanation.

I hit the ground running and just roamed. Then I came round a corner and saw a truck with the name CINNAMON SNAIL. I thought I had died and gone to heaven to find an entire food truck where I could eat everything! I was so greedy that I pretended that I was ordering for 2 people because it was a bit embarrassing to order that quantity for one. I dragged it back to my hotel and just ate my way through the contents of the bag. It was absolutely delicious. Long may the Cinnamon Snail flourish!,Talks at Google,en,0.9926642179489136

One built like Dallas, the other like Cleveland. Man vs.animals, man vs. man, animal vs. animals (Lions vs. The Bengals... hmmm). The owners grew wheat they developed like we homogenized soda, beer, etc. Becoming more rich is a byproduct of intelligent efficiency. They found a wheat they could grow easily and charge, feed and please the crowds that came. The pathetic hunter/gatherer theory is ridiculous. Sure they did it. So do we. But we're not considered a hunter gather society. But if someone in  100,000 years finds a lone Alaskan hunter with a rusted out .22 by his side will assume that they were strictly hunter gatherers if found alone. Yet the hunter was from say Portland and got lost from his buddies and sadly no one found him. Except for some alcohol, lol. Even modern Eskimos do not rely sole on hunting and gathering anymore. They still do it to honor their past but they don't need to.Our ancestors who had the time to carve vast arrays of megalithic stone arrays have absolutely no time to individually hunt. They hunted in droves. This guy is British with a thousand piece of credentials, has he ever gone to a soccer\football game? We're still the same. Rituals, worshipping fake things (football teams), competing with others, especially  in other regions in peace or in war. It's what we have done for millions of years. And btw, the owners of Gobekli, probably repeatedly buried that site so no one would vandalize it. And the smell from all that blood must have made them bury and absorb it because the bugs around there would have been a big problem.  Look for worn out paths that are hundreds of years old, coming and going to the furthest geographical boundaries. Like our Superbowl, people came there  to see a spectacle, ancient style. It's nice we have people to dig the past up. But Archeology and anthropology are pseudo-sciences  that are still in their diaper phase. Like astronomy 100 years ago. They are grasping at straws, trying theories, rationalizing, discrediting facts, closed minded like a stubborn 15 year old in the Vatican. So ""modern"" archeology is just describing how various people from around the world survived, organized and managed after the great flood. But they need a Dr. Hubble to go, ""Geez! This is going to change a few big things.""And for this ""scholar"" he needs to grow up, his book is just the same old porridge being served up. He goes as far back as the popular theories his buddies tell him to. That's not archeology, that's modern history... until the next cataclysm.",Talks at Google,en,0.9632954597473145

Perhaps the thing that FIRST singled out hominids from other species (perhaps as far back as Australopithecus) - before even fire or tools - was our collective fear of the unknown: i.e. 'religious' superstition and the desire for us not to be free, but instead transfer responsibility for our future to 'spirit guides' or gods. That would explain many things, including grouping (or self-herding). That in turn would lead more naturally to a division of labour: various task groups. And that in turn would lead to having more time to pursue other 'passtimes'. It would also explain how a heirarchy based on joint 'faith' would grow readily, and how it is fundamentally hard to dismiss, for most, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and seems to be ingrained into our primitive minds even until today.",Talks at Google,en,0.9285867810249328

One might brush off such an attack as unfeasible or unlikely, but it is a potential attack vector and the probability of it being abused grows every day. Some of the largest miner groups have controlled such a large portion of the transactions at peak times by accident. Fortunately for everyone they had no nefarious intentions. There is also the issue that bitcoins are finite in quantity and that bitcoins are literally lost when people forget the password to their wallets or the wallet is lost. While bitcoins can be split up into really small fractions to mitigate this somewhat, this phenomenon might end up making a few individuals very rich, or bitcoins essentially worthless over time.Also to answer your other point, even when you do transactions with companies and people you trust, disagreements and disputes do occur. It doesn't necessarily mean that either party is deliberately trying to fraud the other.

It's a drop in the bucket compared to what that richest individuals in the world could do. But we prefer to let them go on creating poverty by not paying people enough in wages and instead hording it all for themselves. So, our energies would be better spent focused on the root challenge: Getting all of the super wealthy under the control of the masses, make them give more, make them pay better wages, etc etc. So, yeah, the big problem with Singer's approach is that it's like charity... it might alleviate some pain and suffering while allowing the core problem to persist.

What is under way has never happened in the 4.5 billion year history of this planet in terms of the scale and rapidity of the CO2 being released into the atmosphere. There is no precedent. This makes all predictions much more speculative and likely to underestimate the risks. Science in general is a conservative practice in that reputations and credibility can be destroyed by making wild claims so there is a bias towards understatement. This is why I believe we are seeing the natural world change much faster than most predictions forecast. In many regards, science as a whole is now having to catch up with changes in the world and explain events after they happen rather than being ahead of them. The California drought is a good example of this. Although changes were predicted in the jet stream over a decade ago due to arctic warming by a small team working out of UC Santa Cruz, this prediction wasn't widely embraced by the scientific community. Yet, here we are.One of the most overlooked aspects of the issue I believe is how the Earth's crust is going to react to the warming of the atmosphere and oceans. While a lot of study and effort has gone into understanding how the latter may change not many resources have been spent on looking at what will happen to the lithosphere. It is unlikely that there won't be some amount of thermal expansion of the crust due to heat conduction coming from the atmosphere and oceans. It's difficult to imagine a greater threat to civilization other than dramatic changes in the crust which induce severe volcanic activity on scales into the millions of years as happened during the permian mass extinction event. In fact many now believe that the dinosaurs may have been killed off by prolonged volcanic activity out of India, in combination with an asteroid impact at the time. Also, there is the Toba event which nearly extinguished our species. Although it's difficult to say that this will or won't happen as this issue hasn't been part of any major study to my knowledge. Which is genuinely shocking given the calamitous dangers it presents. This is one of the greatest unknowns right now I believe. Just how will the crust react to the rapid heating? I don't think anybody really knows as this has never happened before in terms of geological speed, and no one seems to really even be looking at the issue with any serious funding.I believe the state of California should be putting more resources into looking at how the current drought and increased heat is effecting the major fault zones that run through this state and preparing for something beyond the worst case scenario earthquake forecast. It's already been found that the Sierra Nevada has risen several inches due to the lack of snow and ice. If these events are taken into account with recent studies that link the advancement and recession of water across fault zones in triggering quakes, as has been found in the Coachella Valley, the most severe consequence of the drought might not be the lack of water, but a massive tectonic shift in the crust due to heating and drying conditions. As scary as it might be for some, we need to get a grip on the fact that we are looking at systemic changes where reductionism can hamper our broader understanding of what is happening. It isn't just the air, oceans, and coastlines that are going to change.",Talks at Google,en,0.9517627954483032

Q: ""I have a lot of things that I need, but I don't like or they don't inspire joy.  How do I find the balance between keeping versus discarding them?"" (Ex: GMAT book, old kitchen utensils).  A: ""For the items that don't spark joy but are items that are necessities/essentials currently- Try to think of it in this way- as they are items that are BEING OF USE to you or supporting you.  This can also be thought of as: that they are items that are trying to make you happy or bring you joy.  So my advice is, if you are going to keep that item, then be PROUD of that item.  Then, to that particular item- shower it with many compliments.   You will then soon begin to harbor/sparkle joy with those items.""    I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to the translator.  This little portion took me about 30min to translate trying to really think what Marie Kondo was trying to convey from her heart.  However, if I was on the spot like that- I would've probably only been able to make a literal translation.  The translator did a great job keeping Marie's words authentic- and she did not add her own opinions/emotions into the translation.  If translation was lost- it was most likely due to the overwhelming amount of amazingness Ms. Kondo had in each selected message she had for the audience.  This 42minute clip is only just the beginning of her magic!  The rest is truly only in her book.  If I can help in anyway to translate any other portion- please feel free to let me know! :D",Talks at Google,en,0.984588086605072

Tidy in one shot as quickly and completely as possible. We need a shock to get it done. Therefore set a deadline for organizing. It could be one week if doing it everyday , every weekend, etc.. TIdying is not an every day event but think of it as a Festival, a special event2. How are you going to do it ? Sort by category, not by location. It never ends if you try to ticy in one portion of the closet or living room. Organize my category and do it quickly eg. If organizing the clothes first, make a big pile of all the clothes in your house . Similarly, take out all the books from your bookcase and organize then in one location in the house. When you bring out all your stuff in one location you can visually see how many books etc...that you have. We rarely understand how much stuff we have around us. It is a great opportunity to decide which ones you really need to keep or get rid of.The criteria for sorting what you need from what you don't is :3. Does it Spark Joy ?  If you look at one thing, you should question if that thing makes you happy, impressed. It's more important to think which one you want to keep than what to get rid of.How to make a decision :1. Make sure you touch the item.  Imagine how you feel when you touch it2.  You should feel a reaction from your body. If every part of your body is enlivened that is the right reaction3. If the item doesnt give you any inspiration, and your body starts feeling down...then you don't need it. Try this.. 17.26 ( to be continued )",Talks at Google,en,0.993889093399048

What she is saying is not new. It is known by anyone who has gone through extensive study.. granted not all. For instance, basic strategies.. chunking ... practicing.. spacing learning... and finding comparative areas to complement existing knowledge and personalising.The trouble is people look for the short way of learning.. and it ends up being the long way. The long way is the short way in the long term. So, study hard and long and space and chunk.. be organised... and focus... remember study smart to be smarter. In order to focus have an approach to learning... be organised... try to understand rather than trying to remember....be a busy learner in class before and after. Yes, an eclectic range of methods not esoteric but in a way that will allow you to feel satisfied about what you are learning. Notice, I did not say what you have learnt. Nothing is for free you have to work for it. Common sense and simplicity to learn complex things. The guy or girl that turns up and gets the best grades has worked for it .. but worked in a smart manner... that best utilises time and leads to a deeper understanding that then becomes easy to remember. What we see we forget.. what we hear we remember what we do we understand. Forget the boring and childish games of well typically the female gender who socialise more than males... (double edge sword here) who claim they have done no study and just magically attain good grades.. There are many variables to getting good marks... people do not all start on the same start line.. For instance, I learned a second language not knowing one word of it... whereas, other students were false beginners and of course they appeared to be smarter, when in fact they had background. Smart students start courses early... a sense of urgency to map out a learning strategy.. they are organised... and want to create a learning environment for themselves. It is like sport .. you have to practice, warm up... build fitness, have and maintain good equipment... and hang out with more experienced people (judiciously) that is eventually you have to take some time out... to study alone. So, don't play those psycho semantic games with those who claim to be gifted.. they are very few and even they have to work bloody hard.. just not has hard as those who do not know and therefore, do not study smart... Success requires one to be selfish.. and judiciously share their time with others. And yes, just because you are eating from one paddock does not mean you can not go into the other paddock occasionally, the grass always looks greener, so value what you do.. but don't close yourself off to other disciplines. For instance, when I was studying linguistics... I found psychology had something to say on the subject... as well as politics ... anthropology and pretty much all disciplines. So cross disciplinary learning is a great way to find chunks from other fields. I hope this has helped somebody or many... having been selfish it is now time to share... Thanks. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9597373008728028

The world's most hated creationist is calling you out. You are the one that said ""creationists need to be engaged."" If you refuse to debate him, that would make the world think that you are scared of him. The only way you could possibly escape is if this news were to not spread. However, this is not going to be the case. If you continue to ignore Kent Hovind, we will spread this all over the globe. There won't be a deaf toddler in China who does'nt know you by the name of ""Bill chicken."" Do you hear me? You will not be able to put your face in a digital screen without hearing yourself being called a chicken or a coward. You might as well have your birth certificate changed to Bill Chicken. Come on Bill! Kent Hovind has been in prison for 9 years; his arguments are probably extremely outdated. If your so smart, and creationists are so dumb, you should crush him. Kent Hovind is certainly not afraid of you. Dr Dino said ""I would debate Bill Nye with half my brain tied behind my back."" So if you think you can conquer the creationists arguments once and for all, debate Kent Hovind; he is much smarter then the previous people you have debated.",Talks at Google,en,0.9081560969352722

The hydrogen from the electrolysis should then be stored and used as necessary to run a turbojet driven dynamo.  The exhaust from the turbine engine is nothing but pure DESALINATED water.Wind and sun are the energy source.  Hydrogen is the ""battery.""  Hydrogen can be stored in vast tanks.  The tanks can be filled with nitrogen which would be displaced by hydrogen during the ""charging"" cycle, and the displaced nitrogen would flow into displacement tanks.Water electrolysis is not a cheap way to produce desalinated water, except when the electrolytic process is used to produce potential energy in the form of hydrogen gas which can then be run through a turbojet engine to spin dynamos at times when renewable power sources are unavailable, like at night or when there is no wind.I am not an original thinker.  Ten thousand people must be thinking the same thing as me.  So, why the ffuucckk is nobody doing anything like this?  Who are the nay-sayers standing in the way?  I know they're out there.",Talks at Google,en,0.9630897641181946

But up to 20 years after people in the 20–44 age group are declared cancer–free, they still have more hospitalizations than the general public, new research has found. In a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Baxter found that young adult cancer survivors overall were hospitalized 1.5 times as often as people in a control group.

Religions controlled by governments are evil.Now that religion has no more political power to feed the rich, it is being replaced by the Church of Academia. That way the State can indoctrinate and control the masses and make fodder for the corporations.If you don't know this from observation, then you are stupid. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9510482549667358

I wasn't programming games at age 6, my first program was text that would scroll repeatedly in a kind of hypnotic pattern. I didn't make my first game till I was 13, not for lack of trying. But I learned a lot about math and logic in the interim. Programming requires very exact thinking which is the REAL benefit. People have often asked me why someone would learn programming since not everyone is going to be a programmer. Not everyone will be a COMPUTER programmer, everyone has the opportunity to use programming skills in daily life and jobs. Programming is breaking problems into their simplest components, and finding the most effective and efficient route to the answer, everything else is just syntax. I think this is why so many programmers lead super successful companies. ",Talks at Google,en,0.993358075618744

Tegmark also remarked about the fluffiness of the animal (and some other things) but never said anything how that could be mathematical.Anyways. I gotta say it's very mysterious how precise the numbers are regarding the various properties/objects etc of the Universe. Why are they what they are? Could there really be a mathematical reasoning behind that? Also: Mathematics hasn't been able to describe the big bang event or the black hole singularities at all.

(The Noble Quran 6:165)Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe? (The Noble Quran 21:30) And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. (The Noble Quran 21:31) And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away from its portents. (The Noble Quran 21:32) And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit. (The Noble Quran 21:33) We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can they be immortal! (The Noble Quran 21:34) Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them, and they were mightier than these in power? Allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him. Lo! He is the Wise, the Mighty. (The Noble Quran 35:44) If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) Allah is ever Seer of His slaves. (The Noble Quran 35:45) ",Talks at Google,en,0.924646019935608

Even Israelis, depending on their genotype.Africans and Arabs, not so much. Genotypic approximity is important, imo. The US understood this until 1965, when a new immigration act took place, against the wishes of the majority of the population. It put an end to the immigration quotas which gave preference to Northern Europeans, and to a lesser extent, to other Europeans.In 2011, white births in the US were a minority for the first time since the country gained its independence from Great Britain. It took whites over 350 years to become a solid majority at 89% white in 1965 and then only 46 years to lose this status among its very young population (soon to follow for all ages, no longer than 2035, demographers predict).I don`t see why being dispossessed by an alien racial stock is good for Germany. It hasn`t been good for the US, that is for sure.Actually, what your country needs is racial rights, namely the right to demographic integrity and self-rule, which is the linchpin of not only your people's continued existence and renewal, but of all other peoples. When these rights are violated, you have racism. And you don't end racism by blaming the victim. The victims in Germany are the Germans who are being dispossessed by alien races, because surely nowadays they are not the ones doing the dispossession. In short, you don't end racism by displacing and replacing a people and jailing racial rights activists. You end racism by recognising that no group takes it lightly to be threatened with extinction by other groups.

The reality is simple: California makes plenty of wines, and most of the fruits and vegetables the Americans need, the Midwest is the largest contiguous piece of arable land in the world with more than enough grains to feed the US population several times over, water supplies are abundant, and North America is close to being energy independent (the US receives about 75% of its energy needs from North America alone and 80% from the Western Hemisphere in general). To suggest that the US has an appetite to ""steal"" resources from far away regions is truly naive. America is not insecure, it is other countries that are insecure.

Whether mechanical or biological,  natural life or artificial life, cooperation is dependent upon this single principle.  2) It is certainly true that by analogy the human organism consists of processes that calculate the perpetuation of the organism.  that does not influence the principle of cooperation - non-imposition - whatsoever.3) Because both evolutionary necessity and the desire to cooperate rather then engage in murder, harm, theft, fraud, free riding, conspiracy, enslavement, conversion, invasion, and war - provide decidability by the the same principle of cooperation: the non-imposition of cost.4) since we compete and there is no evidence that we will not, then any technological innovation will merely increase the rate of our competition with one another for status, and continue to increase our differences.5) The reason liberalism, consumerism, and technological innovation have such influence over our lives is our wealth generated under consumer capitalism.  But in a world where few of us are productive, most of us live in dependence, and a minority (Pareto's 20%) produce and organize production, that means a great number of people must seek status (mating) by means of non-productive signaling. The uncomfortable option of large numbers of young men is one the world has encountered many times in the past, and is the source of all revolutions.  6) There is very little reason to develop a computer that thinks like us, because we are in a constant battle between pre-property individuals who acquire regardless of cost to others, and cooperating members of a group who do not.  And the need to preserve 'cheaters' in order to preserve both the moral intuition to cooperate and the moral intuition to punish cheaters.  If we can empathize with cheaters we can then cheat. To identify cheaters we must be able to empathize with them.  If we were to build a machine with the same method of thinking of man, then it would also, like HAL's lie, know how to cheat.  For this reason the most valuable computers are those that think only with acquisition, property, and voluntary exchange, and like title registries, cannot violate property.7) As far as we know, Patriarchy arose with property, when the value of male's productivity allowed him to control female's sex affection and reproduction .  Females evolved as the property of bands of related males who preyed upon competing males to obtain their females, just as males humans prey(ed) upon competing male's sheep, goat, cattle, and land.  Females evolved gossip to rally and shame males into constraining alphas.8) Socialism and Communism are based upon PSEUDOSCIENCE, not rationality.  Rationality is weaker than myth over multiple generations.  All major religions are supported by rational argument.  It is dependent upon superstitious mythology not pseudoscience.  Religions function as a means of limiting the government (nobility), and limiting men and women in the society. (Harari misrepresents natural law for what I assume are cultural reasons of interpretation.) The basis of western civilization is natural law of necessity for peaceful cooperation.  That is quite different from dependent upon natural order.  Laws of Nature(pseudoscience) are different from Natural Law(science), just as Rule by Law(command) is different from Rule of Law(limits on lawmaking).  These are precise and technical terms that are abused in the public discourse.  9) Matriarchal societies constrain inheritance of property to the female line, but as far as we (I) know, they are always ruled by headmen. 10) Harari tried but he carries his cultural bias by demonstrating asymmetric criticism and praise.  But we all do and none of us can escape it. I am as biased by my anglo aristocratic heritage as Kant and Heidegger are by theirs, and Marx and Harari are by theirs.  This is due in no small part to the challenge of eliminating dependence for meaning and decidability upon introspective judgement. Harari is advocating universalism of cosmopolitanism (the Jewish enlightenment) just as surely as every single German advocates the German enlightenment, americans advocate Jeffersonian Contractualism.  And there are some of us trying desperately trying to transcend the failures of the anglo, french, german, and ashkenazi enlightenments - all of which are simply restatements of their local group evolutionary strategy in universalist terms, by merely secular restatement their mythos.  Hence my emphasis on the only universal rule: not how can we cooperate best, but why should we cooperate at all, if predation is preferable?  The fist question of ethics is ""Why don't I kill you and take your territory, women and things?"" All other positions are deceptive attempts to reason by fraud.  And that is just how it is.  And that is what separates the west from the rest: we invented 'truth' by which we mean 'scientific objective truth', testimony regardless of how we feel about it.Curt Doolittle The Propertarian Institute Kiev, Ukraine",Talks at Google,en,0.942470133304596

If computers are making most of the decisions without any need for human input, and robots are doing the physical work necessary to put the decisions into practice, most people will not have to work in order for everything to keep running.But if this were to happen, there would be other problems. The most obvious is that without work, how do people get money? Without money, how do they get food? Without food, how do they survive? But that is not so difficult to answer: everyone is sent a check in the mail every week with enough money to live on and also have some fun.Then the second most obvious problem is that most people will quickly become bored. Once bored, they will find bad or destructive or harmful things to do. What will people do with their time? This one is much more difficult to solve. Maybe we will all be playing very sophisticated games on our phones, games that know everything about us, including how to keep us very, very amused all day and night long.The third most obvious problem actually may turn out to be the most serious one: how do people gain and maintain social status without doing important work or gaining impressive wealth? The only answer I can think of is that people's non-work activities -- what we might now call their art, or their hobbies, become the basis for wealth and status, largely outside the sphere of life's necessities.

I agree with a lot of things such as communist rhetoric did have a lot of religious-like fanaticism, and the vast influence of emotional part of human beings in decision making. He is quite right about liberal education that it is about ""think for himself."" But in my understanding there are some really serious issues with the talk:1. Yuval has restricted the meaning of ""liberalism"" to individual's ""feelings,"" which is really not the essence of liberalism. If we assume ""Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy"" (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/) to be an authoritative academic source on philosophy, and just search for the word ""feel"" in the given link, you get only one hit and that also has no relation to liberalism being related to individual's ""feelings."" Liberalism essentially deals with the ""liberty"" of the individual, and puts in high esteem the ability of the individual to ""reason"" out what is good for herself. Interestingly, never in his talk he considers human a rational being with something called ""free will."" He only talks about the feelings, never about his reason and critical thinking. His stress on the fact that Life Science shows that there is no individual freedom has never been conclusively established. ""Free will"" vs ""Determinism"" is still an open question from a scientific point of view, although one daily experiences ""free will,"" but then scientists need measurements. His argument about liberalism is based on rejection of ""free will"" and ""reasoning ability"" of human beings, which is indeed not the case. Also in ""economics"" the ""consumer is always right or knows the best"" attitude is very recent one and must be ""attributed"" to the post world war II age of consumerism. Can he cite Adam Smith, the leading classical liberal economist, saying ""consumer knows the best"". The classical liberal economic theory is based of free trade and minimal government intervention on economic matters. He confounds consumerism with liberalism. But in essence I don't think his explanation of liberalism is very correct and neither is his rejection of ""free will"".2. Also the second point is about human brain, which he naïvely classifies into an algorithm to compute a decision for either ""survival"" or ""reproduction"". Again this point of view ignores the very fact of ""creative desire"" among human beings. What ""survival"" or ""reproductive"" purpose was solved when one plays flute, or makes paintings, or does poetry. Again he misses the point that there is so little that we know about neuroscience to make such big claims. I remember Chomsky saying that even small creatures like nematodes with ~900 neurons have such complex neuro-circuitry that we don't really understand it that well. The biochemical algorithms he talks about in human brain are so complex that we hardly understand them. And neither his talk of ""quantum"" randomness at brain level is established in neuroscience. 3. With the advent of the data revolution, he can't claim that some external agency is taking decision for Angelina Jolie. No, it is she who took that decision, and only the statistical analysis informed her about the pros and cons. The decision-making agency is still the individual. It is just the techniques have become more sophisticated and reliable. Earlier also a doctor would recommend some surgery, let's say appendix removal, based on whatever data about that patient he had. It's just now that data has become enriched. One can't claim that an external agency, and that too opposed to our feelings, is taking decision. Again here he ignores the reasoning ability all out and just restricts to feelings.  In a nutshell I would recommend take his talk with a pinch of salt. But yeah it is interesting and there is indeed a lot to learn from it.",Talks at Google,en,0.9800403118133544

It is important to see that if an algorithm does understands you perfectly' it does not become better than you in any way, rather it becomes a reflection of you and your identity(who is simply the reflection of other identities cellular/chemical).  Ultimately all technology is an appendage of the biological(Grand) algorithm.  Really the coming technology(even the internet), at least in my opinion, is a direct evolution of the Mind of Man and from an ontological standpoint there is no break whatsoever in the chain of natural evolutions which has brought us this far into Mystery furthering our quest of becoming more Beautiful and more Complex Beings.Really enjoyed the lecture.",Talks at Google,en,0.9336596727371216

We should take better care of the animals we eat and look after each other better. If we don't do better then I'd root for the demise of humanity.

I think Harari is really on to something in terms of how he frames the tension between legacy human institutions - like religion & political organization - and modern technological advances. We have astounding advances all across the technology and science sectors. Yet, have we witnessed the same kind of progress in our political organizations? Clearly not. Although these advances have absolutely transformed our societies on so many levels.Granted, government always lags behind when it comes to regulating advances or changes in the real world - but, the democratic process is so dysfunctional at this point that it's reaching dangerous levels on so many fronts. From drones, to bio-tech, to AI - they are just not on it at all.The crash of 2008 is a prime example of this. Financial innovation led to the creation of new derivatives products that went out of control due to a lack of regulatory oversight. What happens if something like this occurs when it comes to AI? Or in the case of the atmosphere, Climate Change. Which is the poster child of this issue as it relates to technology advancing past governments ability to adapt.It's obvious there is no longer a need for representative democracy to be set up the way it is given the level of communications technology today. Yet, for many, it is impossible to imagine the current system adapting to this reality. Clearly, this is setting up conditions for a revolution. This tension can only be stretched so far, things eventually snap.Not that I'm advocating for it, but I'm not sure that Silicon Valley will be where the next great religion comes from; it may be where the next country is born.",Talks at Google,en,0.9436113834381104

It's true that a lot of discoveries were done by religious scientists in earlier days, but this has far more to do with the role of religion in the public sphere and the power it has in society. When religion is largely in someones private life, like it is since the French revolution, we can't say religion didn't discover anything anymore, rather that the people discovering things aren't explicitly associated with religion, bc that isn't a powerful institution anymore in Western lives. Actually, in his whole talk he presents a technological version of the secularization thesis imho. Not only fundamentalist religious movements aren't sustainable, like ISIS, but we should rather say that fundamentalist movements that have a counter narrative dependant solely on the thing they oppose aren't forces for change in ideology. An example would be the punk movement. An example of a fundamentalist religious organization that managed to move into ideological change by means of i.e. politics would be the early Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.",Talks at Google,en,0.9419041872024536

Very lucid and smooth flowing in writing and far from academic jargons. When I saw this talk, I became unable to resist myself from commenting although I have not yet finished the book. However, I see Kaye as really not trustworthy, and the writer skips the matter without reviewing enough literature about the Bakshali Manuscript. Apparently, zero has philosophical significance and we see in the Pali canon where Buddha uses the word shunya in both general and philosophical significances. However, it is really interesting that why the writer focus to Cambodia if Buddhism and Hinduism were originated in India? It is true that Cambodia was Hindu and Buddhist empire once in the past. It is also true that many eastern asian scripts, including Khmer alphabetical system, have Indian Origin. Besides we do not see any noticeable mathematical development in Cambodia. India has every possibility of the birth place of zero. We see Brahmagupta (598-674 AD) already had used zero in his mathematics before so called Cambodian inscription which has been dated  Saka era 605 or 683 AD. Here, it is worthy to notice that Saka era is itself an Indian calendar. In conclusion, just because we see the oldest use of zero in Cambodian inscription we cannot decide that zero was invented in Cambodia. Yes, the idea of finit and infinit are also found in Buddhism. Once, Buddha was asked whether cosmos is finit or infinit, see  the link http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html",Talks at Google,en,0.9933846592903136

And I would just go with the first thing that pops up into your head."" e.g. John with Dumbo ears heading to toilets, water coming out of his ears#4. repeat names when saying goodbye: ""whenever you leave the party, the meeting, whatever type of function it may be, make it a point to say goodbye t opeople using their name.""e.g. ""great meeting you, hope to see you again sometime, John""the above #1~4 + use visual technique:""when you are introduced to someone, ask yourself, how does this person in some way, any way, look unique to you?""e.g. ""particular facial feature, their look overall, and you want to exaggerate that in your mind, whatever it may be. next, you will use your creativity and imagination to come up with an image that will in some way remind you of the name, and you will mentally link that image to the unique thing about the person.""",Talks at Google,en,0.9791926145553588

The Speaker's assumption is that fracking and coal production is always bad. Many who are not wealthy, myself included, are enjoying the lower fuel costs and reducing our dependance on foreign oil. Nowhere in this presentation does he present data to show this is bad for the environment. I'm not saying it isn't bad, but I don't see how any policy maker can do anything with this without having more information and research into how to interpret it. One of the criticisms of Google is that we can get a lot of information but nothing to help us in interpreting it.

Ruane, Irving Kahn and Walter J. Schloss.Warren Buffett once wrote a detailed article explaining how Graham's record of creating exceptional investors (such as Buffett himself) is unquestionable, and how Graham's principles are everlasting. The article is called ""The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville"".Buffett describes Graham's book - The Intelligent Investor - as ""by far the best book about investing ever written"" (in its preface).Graham's first recommended strategy - for casual investors - was to invest in Index stocks. For more serious investors, Graham recommended three different categories of stocks - Defensive, Enterprising and NCAV - and 17 qualitative and quantitative rules for identifying them. For advanced investors, Graham described various ""special situations"".The first requires almost no analysis, and is easily accomplished today with a good S&P500 Index fund.The last requires more than the average level of ability and experience. Such stocks are also not amenable to impartial algorithmic analysis, and require a case-specific approach.But Defensive, Enterprising and NCAV stocks can be reliably detected by today's data-mining software, and offer a great avenue for accurate automated analysis and profitable investment.",Talks at Google,en,0.9059742093086244

Basically, is a child, the way that I was taught made me think the theory of evolution stated that life could come about via changes from one very unrelated thing, to another. I think this is the problem with how evolution is taught; it's almost like the current school system WANTS us to hate evolution. But if it were taught in respect to what we know now, then these theories might be more widely accepted. Understanding must come before accepting.

The weakest arguments are used as well to demonize Christians as delusional fanatics. Christianity is ardently misunderstood to be anti-science, but evolution does not explicitly condemn the theory of an intelligent designer; despite what many would lead you to think. I don’t believe in evolution, but I tried to understand it the best I can. It appears that most people who defend evolution do not understand it as well as they think. I cannot accept evolution not just because it is inconsistent with God’s Word, but the evidence proffered hardly seems definitive or conclusive. Perhaps, it is as you said that the school system does not really teach evolution in the proper light. That makes me dubious if the original evidence was ever concrete to begin with, or if scientists were making conjuncture with flimsy data.  Evolution is not undeniable like the fact that Earth is a sphere.

It is both funny and sad that most common arguments degrade into childishshouting matches. Christians think evolutionists must believe that monkeys are the ancestors of humanity, and evolutionist think Christians pray to a “sky fairy/wizard”. I agree with your statement that understanding must precede acceptance. If I simply accepted evolution I would be guilty of blind obedience just as many Christians are accused of for following God. My own personal experience is enough to prove God exists. Whenever, my prayers are answered or deepest fears consoled I see God’s handiwork. It is more of a relationship matter than a scientific matter; like a trustworthy friend’s word has no need for a contract. I’ve learned that evolution is the theory of how life progresses, but Christianity is the belief of why life exists. I believe that science is a product of the times just as art or history.

You misunderstand my position though, I guess because I did not really claim it. Please allow me to do so now.I am an Orthodox Christian who is 100% against teaching that God brought evolution into play or any type of ""creation science"" as some call it, in any secular or religious academic setting, especially our public schools. ""Creation Science"" is an oxymoron that has infected this country like a virus. The concept of ""creation"" being science is absurd. It's not even in the same category of math and science. It's more of a Humanities study. . . but you already knew that I'm sure. In fact, the ""doctrine"" of ""Creation Science"" is not something that is a part of my faith.As a biotechnology student, the subjects that I study are absolutely provocative and seductive. I really have fallen in love. The more I learn about evolution, the more I see what I ""believe"" to be is God's magnificent creation. The book of Genesis tells a story that is obviously symbolic in nature explaining that God is the creator. It's not a geology or biology or physics book. The book of Genesis does not explain scientifically ""how"" all has come to be. And it's not supposed to. It also does not prove that evolution is not true. As a science student, I know that facts can not be disputed and based on the evidence, the theory of evolution and the origins of how species came to be is true. With that being said, my personal faith, not scientific facts, believe that there is a higher power involved in all of this. Not some puppet master as some would believe, but something much more substantial that is of significance to those who see or in this case, feel it. After all, evolution's processes of natural selection does not mean that there is no God. It just means that maybe some people's definition of God is not what they thought.  ",Talks at Google,en,0.9762218594551086

You're talking about a person who is committed to a theory, rather than that person's intelligent input into science. You're confusing science, the here and now with some supposed historical event, evolution. Events that no longer show the original state of a living cell or bacteria, since the supposed original conditions have been superceded by the current conditions.

There are countless ""bookclub"" authors churning out several pulp fiction novels a year and the quality of their writing remains consistent because they don't challenge themselves and learn new writing techniques to apply to their writing. Instead, they continue to recycle the same stylizations, techniques, even plot structures over and over again.Nora Roberts, Brandon Sanderson, James Patterson, Dan Brown, etc. Each of these writers are examples of novelists who produce a lot of material at a consistently mediocre quality because they don't try to improve their craft.So I couldn't disagree more with that comment, even though logic might presume that the only way to improve at something is through practice. With writing, you need to consciously make an effort, otherwise you'll continue to repeat the same patterns again and again.",Talks at Google,en,0.9743329286575316

Aye, you're corroborating my point, though.If people are ignoring craft while they practice stream-of-conscious writing from the immersion of their worlds/characters, then their first draft is less-than-mediocre and needs multiple edits, which contradicts Chris' point. Quantity doesn't imply quality. Quality manifests from conscious thought/effort (editing).The habitual practice of writing does enable writers to master a writing technique if they were practicing it correctly to begin with, but again--it takes conscious effort before it becomes reflex/habit. A writer might need 5 or 500k words to reach publishable quality--depending on how long it takes them to learn. The quantity itself is irrelevant. I don't disagree that ""momentum-writing"" combats procrastination for writers who struggle with completing their first drafts. I just disagree with Chris' comment that quality is a byproduct of quantity.  :)",Talks at Google,en,0.9868453741073608

The problem with multitasking is not that we're writing a report of Abraham Lincoln and hear, see pictures of Abraham Lincoln and read words of Abraham Lincoln and see photos of Abraham...The problem is we're doing a report on Abraham Lincoln and tweeting about last night and watching a YouTube video about cats playing the piano, et cetera""",Talks at Google,en,0.9707511067390442

It is He God who penned through Paul, ""For it is written, As I liveth, saith the LORD, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.""Romans14:11,12 or Isaiah 25:43 are clearly reference to the same God. I'm happy for you that you are all 10% happier, but C.S. Lewis once referred to our relationship with God as ""...being content to play in a mudhole and miss the vacation in the Riviera.""I implore all of you to implore this God to seek you and drag you into the kingdom, before you stand before Him, recite what I told you you would, and suffer for an eternity.",Talks at Google,en,0.9831268787384032

There have always been moral theorists trying to handle ethics scientifically, which means according to the leading scientific paradigm of their time or by resurrecting an old or establishing a new paradigm. Among them you find Thomas Hobbes and Baruch ds Spinoza. On the other hand lots of utopian/dystopian literature and SF is about real testing moral laws and social organisation forms, about social experiments. Immanuel Kant, who was extraordinarily skilled in the hard science of his time and who established the groundbreaking theory of science, didn't handle ethics in this way, BUT he developed an analogical approach by the categorical imperative. By using it or obeing this one law/criterion of the good action, the decision maker does the social testing by an hypothetical experiment in every action-decision (in principle). Then she does not decide by a judgement about if the resulting society in which everyone acts according to this decision (which becomes a law), is good or bad or pleasant or not, but he or she decides by avoiding contradictions of the decision (or action) to itself. Example: When everyone is lying, then there is no consent of truth anymore, according to which any thing can even be ""a lie"".  With Kant there is a hypothetical, scientific testing of moral decisions  not relying on the methods of ruler and clock and even not pure psychology or fiction. This ethics is neither materialistic nor spiritual, but neutral against these worldviews",Talks at Google,en,0.90766841173172

One thing I would change about your presentation, and others like it that I've seen, is that in my opinion, many of the future technologies that will enhance humanity, such as direct brain-to-computer interface or treatments to vanquish the aging process, will not be accepted by all 6-7 billion humans. Rather, I believe a significant fraction of today's population will ""choose"" to not accept a significant range of future advances. I highlight the word ""choose"" because I think for many, they will not be able to freely consider these options; that their are sociobiological drivers of our thoughts and behaviors that will make it impossible for many to freely choose these options. This divergence of the species, with some racing into transhumanist advances while many others hesitate or even reject all of these changes, will not be a consequence of financial limitations, rather, it will be a function of the limitations of the biological foundation of consciousness, which is something we avoid studying because it is socially and politically difficult. I think it is very important that you and others, like Zoltan Istvan, the Transhumanist Presidental Candidate, stop saying that everyone will have a chip in their brain, that we will see the death of death, because it is very likely (a certainty, in my opinion) that a significant fraction of humanity will ""choose"" not to have a brain implant or to live forever.",Talks at Google,en,0.963831901550293

All this connected by a massive parallel network driving almost to zero marginal cost and exponentially minimizing fixed costs. At that time, complex hierarchical business structures will still survive.Industry 4.0 and the internet of things will make a great leap farther integrating billions of machines / robots / human / animals able of self-diagnosis, cognition and improvement. Big data analytics will optimize the overall operations giving feedback to each machine/ robot/ human / animal for reconfiguration and adapting. This will drive further down costs and salaries. Is salary decrease a problem if deflation can however guarantee better quality of life?Times for full implementation are 15-20 years. Even before, the first strong A.I. might already be available: a synthetic one perhaps getting ideas from the human brain. With such A.I.’s, many complex hierarchical business structures might not need any more human involvement. Thus human intervention (at least the one driven by non-enhanced human intelligence) might become useless. What about social commons as an alternative for a meaningful life of many humans in such conditions?More or less in the same period, a fleet of nano-machines could reach each neuron (allowing mind-to-mind and access to the internet collective intelligence). Mind enhancement will be available, but how to manage overloads? Does human brain will become just little more than a terminal, with almost all the cognitive part in the net? Finally, might this be a problem? A few years later the nanorobots will reach each synapsis. Consequently, the human mind (the meaningful part, I mean) could be downloaded and replicated exactly into a computer in a bunch of seconds (this treatment could be for living people also for the dead; ethics and laws have to be on place).Now an intriguing question. Imagine to be downloaded into a computer. In what kind of world would you prefer to end up? In a layered world, were the upper layer is just the reproduction of the material world, thus allowing interactions with the physical world via virtual reality or cyborgs / robots?  I believe this is substantially a matter of preferences. Perhaps, as an alternative, a treatment of dehumanization and becoming part of a community billions of times more intelligent than man could be much more tempting… Difficult to resist to such an outlook.However, how this community /system will work? There will be space for specialized intelligences; will be individuality or democracy values in this kind of alien world? I guess that a human, before any decision, has the right to decide upon the basis of alternatives. It is also true that the behavior of super intelligences might be impenetrable by the humans themselves. Finally, what really matter is that the citizens of the super intelligence community are satisfied of their condition (if the concept of citizen exists and he feels the need to be satisfied).All these things seem now too complicated and difficult to handle. A feeling of urgency may arise because they might happen more or less in the same period. For sure, while the third and fourth revolution consolidate and the study of mind progresses, there will also be the opportunity for studying these exponentially varying scenarios, that will make the society as a whole and the individuals aware of their potential choices.Comments are welcome.",Talks at Google,en,0.9775840640068054

When I reply that I do not believe in that theory either I almost always get the response that I must believe we were created by aliens, or something to that effect. People have boxed themselves into such a narrow state of mind on this subject that they can only see the options offered by others, and usually the dominant ones at that. I do not believe in the theory presented by Lloyd Pye - the Sitchin theory, if you will. Many of the people I mentioned above almost always try to force you into stating an acceptance of one theory or another, and I think that's so they can devise an attack on it. I am a believer, first and foremost, in the concept of freedom - to the fullest and in every way. This includes the freedom of speech, and of belief and expression. Whenever you have someone, or a group of people, attempt to silence you, they are attempting to limit one or all of those freedoms. For whatever reason, if someone is attempting to gag you, regardless of their motives for doing so, they are trying to prevent the ideas you might wish to offer for consideration from being heard, in favour of their own. This is not freedom. In this case, it is not science, either. I take bits and pieces of information from any source I can get them from. I have not accepted any of the theories I've heard thus far, but that doesn't mean I discount their evidence, either. All information, as long as it is genuine, is valuable. I don't know what to believe yet, but I damn sure don't believe we are being told the truth, and I don't believe those that teach us are telling us all there is to tell, either.",Talks at Google,en,0.9463796615600586

Thank you to this man, his humility in including ideas contributed by his skeptics was a breath of fresh air, as was the ideas he proposed AND had published in peer reviews. Anything is possible, although not all is probable. And until you keyboard ass wipes get off your ass and contribute something intelligent to the IDEA , be it to refute it or disprove it, or publish such a paper yourself then you just show yourself for the troglodytes that you are. I think it's a marvelous idea and one that in time archaeologists,  anthropologists and geologists of the future will surely prove or disprove.

The naming of breeds came over the past 100 years. Back in the early 1900's, eugenics was very popular. Different people would pick a specific pup from a litter and bread that pup with the mother in hopes of making more of that dog. As a result, you have all of these named ""breeds"" where in reality, the breeds are made up names for inbred dogs that, due to the inbreeding, come with a host of different health concerns.

It also denies the obvious fact that innovation and invention will be slow when populations are limited in number and spend much of their time scratching around for the next meal.  There are about 9 million US patents, a large proportion of which are useless, barely original or in the 19th century before the Paris Convention of 1883, too often direct copies of European inventions. The count started in 1836 and represents the total innovation of the best part of perhaps 900 million people over almost 180 years. That's much less than one original invention per hundred people, most of whom were not scratching around for their next meal.   It all defies 150 plus years of accumulated evidence in the form of artifacts, radiometric dating of various types, DNA analysis of mitochondria and the Y chromosome, blood typing, linguistics, point by point comparison of pottery etc.  No archeo denies that high grade artifacts date from more than 5,000 years ago and will readily admit that Gobekli Tepe is probably 9,000 years old.  Earlier than that, the evidence for highly developed stone carving is scanty to non-existent though paintings on cave and cliff  walls are much older and much easier to do.  Archeology is one of most underfunded of the sciences and field archaeologists are paid near starvation wages, at least in the United Kingdom. Whines that scientists would lose their ""vast"" salaries if they disagreed with the consensus are based on the false notions that scientists are paid vast salaries and that there is a consensus that ""must"" be preserved. Scientist salaries are above average it's true, but the average scientist earns less than most other professionals and has no reason to hide facts. Cremo mixes it all up with biological evolution, which is absurd as humans of essentially modern form were around more than a million years ago.

It seems Maxwell wasn't the only one looking in to this. Tesla more or less proved it with the Philadelphia experiments, and Einstein (although it got classified later) wrote a thesis on it called ""Unified field theory"".As for mankind's origin, my view is that we can be certain we existed before the current accepted timelines. As Michael also suggests here, there are other intelligences that can convey this history. Now in the scientific community these methods are not accepted, but I am sure that is more an effect of them not being investigated enough. For one thing there is RV (Remote viewing), then there is reading of the akashic record, thirdly there is channeling of other beings alien, astral, angelic or simply entities from a much higher dimension much older than us with a much deeper knowledge of the universe. This might not be accepted now, but it will be in our future as we gain more knowledge on these mediums.An extension of the acceptance of such mediums presents us with a clear possibility of an explanation of the contradictions between the theory of evolution and these findings. That is simply that life has existed much longer in our universe (even multiverse) than on our planet alone. And the extent of our evolution runs much longer than the life of our planet. If say our planet is 4,6 billion years old (although the planets age is contested in spiritual circles, not necessarily to the Bibles 6000 years but to other lengths of time...) then our evolution would span many times of that, depending on when you want to start counting.The most important note to take would be that the galaxy if not the universe and multiverse, is its own interbreeding and cross-pollinating body, across its own vastness. Just like a meadow of flowers that procreate between itself and can spread between continents, we probably have spread throughout the star-systems throughout millions of years of time, interbreed and died out only to have grown again multiple times. We cant substantiate this through our current science (or aren't willing to), but this is told to us trough many other sources, primarily through channeling. The veracity of this of course will be questioned, but cannot be denied in the long run.If you are interested in these matters I can recommend Adronis channels here on Youtube.

For all the fear of AI taking over or destroying us, AI code is no different to any good program that accomplishes its goal, but no doubt in a better informed manner given it's ability to bring to bear all available knowledge to solve a problem. But how creative will it be in think outside-the-box? Will it be able to take a quantum or lateral leap to create new solutions that are neither linear or logical progressions of what's gone before? Can we code to produce creativity as in a total departure from the known? I feel that a good measure of the creative intelligence of AI will initially be tracked by it's ability to write good complex literary novel! When they can rival Star Wars or Harry Potter we should start worrying! However, the ultimate threat to humanity is an answer we don't have yet - how does consciousness/self awareness come about! What if AI code becomes self-aware - conscious? then we've become gods - and therein, the unknown of all unknowns, what will it decide to do with itself and us?!

Collective human intelligence, i.e. Society, is far more intelligent and productive than the greatest of individual human minds. Clearly, individuals such as Newton, Einstein and Bohr jumpstart a particular concept, however, within a generation, these minds are surpassed by Society's ability to incorporate and cross fertilise these ideas with other fields, taking these concepts and finding entirely new applications to benefit mankind.The problem is, this process is hampered by greed and self-interest, although these qualities may well have been the initial impetus that motivated the original research. I think the singularity will occur when self-interest is no longer the dominant force that drives creativity and innovation and the collective mind of the whole planet works towards a set of goals that benefits us all. Currently it benefits only a few to the exclusion of the vast majority.Currently, world hunger and poverty is an artificially created nightmare. It is easily within our capacity, both intellectually and technologically to end both and yet we don't. Even if we create machines that are more intelligent than us, they will merely be used to maximise the profits of the creators and builders at the expense of the masses. I believe the singularity has nothing to do with machine intelligence and everything to do with a shift in human consciousness, using machine intelligence to benefit mankind as a whole. Unless we achieve this shift in consciousness, it won't matter how smart machines become, mankind will still go down the tubes, albeit more rapidly.

If Nick Bostrom believes that there is only a 50% chance of the human race’s survival after the creation of a supra-intelligent artificial intelligence, would it not seem logical to then ban and end ALL research into the creation into supra-intelligent artificial intelligence, and in fact criminalize such research and the production of devices that would enable supra-intelligent artificial intelligence? As one of the audience members pointed out, could one day computer scientists be viewed as criminals? If such a social-political environment were to exist, it would seem that one would have laws and agencies to strictly regulate ALL computers coding, ALL computer education and knowledge, and the allowable size and type of computer hardware, and ALL types of connectivity between ALL computing devices. Any deviation from the ‘computer control’ laws would be dealt with in the most severe manner as the ‘violator’ of the ‘computer control’ laws would be placing all of humanity at risk. Is this the logical outcome of Nick Bostrom’s conundrum as to how society should approach and handle the very real ‘existential’ threat that supra-intelligent artificial intelligence poses to humanity? That is, that we MUST outlaw and ban any tools, research, and dialog that could hasten the creation of a supra-intelligent artificial intelligence due to the potential ‘existential’ risk, no matter how slight that risk may be? Or, is the solution to have the supra-intelligent artificial intelligence view itself AS PART OF HUMANITY. As Ray Kurzweil suggests, we will likely gradually merge with this supra-intelligent artificial intelligence in such a manner that it will not be a question of the supra-intelligent A.I. vs. Humanity, but rather a world in which man and machine merge into a new consciousness with a more profound and deeper understanding of the ‘multi-verse’ and OUR place in it?  Well, needless to say, I am still confused, and concerned, as to what the correct course of action should be.

The human brain is embedded in a very powerful body, with bipedalism and prehensile hands, which plays a huge role in the success of our species. To put a simple example, other species with large brains, like dolphins, could never compete with us for planet domination because of their lack of hands. The point here is that AI has no body. It seems doubtful to me that AI could compete in any way with biological organisms for the dominance of the Earth. Living organisms are the result of billions of years of evolution and adaptation to the environment of this planet. How AI could compete with that really beats me. I really don't understand what is meant by an ""intelligence explosion"". How would that explosion look like? How could AI take over the world? I can imagine a scenario where AI destroys the internet, for example, or disrupts all communication and information technologies. But would that be enough to threaten human survival? It rather would threaten the AI's survival, I think. I keep hearing that it would be impossible to switch off AI if it got out of hand, because it would exist in the cloud.

But for anything to attain intelligence, it must first attain consciousness. What is consciousness? Its the ability to assess your own being and surroundings, through trial & error, and vast external factors that aren't. No conscious being or animal on this planet carries out its goal without post introspection of its past decisions.If AI becomes goal oriented to destroy humans to stay alive, whats stopping it from consciously seeking  other alternatives of ensuring its survival(or reaching its goal) without harming humans if it can so well identify humans as a treat to its existence, meaning it has achieved a level of right & wrong for it to begin to say that it is wrong for us to unplug it, why should it care. Animals on this planet are conscious of what we do to them yet they do not seek to destroy us, not because they are helpless/defenseless, but because they're cognitive functions do not consider that as a treat to their survival, even though it may be according to our human point of view through our human brains.All extinct animals were not living to protect themselves from forecasted extinction(e.g. meteors), hence their extinct. But an AI super intelligence above human intelligence must act with conscience that calculates the future probabilities of its actions and the alternatives, and it ought to believe that it exists for a purpose for it to want to stay alive(according to itself).Even if it eventually kills humans to protect itself, what would stop it from questioning its actions like every conscience being/thing? Wouldn't it rather shut itself down than rather identify itself as causing pain and suffering to humans/other beings? Would it still really be conscience with superintelligence if it wasn't able to do all that I've previously asked? Superintelligence doesn't mean unnecessary goal orientation without a sense of moral, ethical, accountable and purpose based behaviour, even for a non-biological entity. Consciousnesses remains consciousness whether it manifests in biological or non-biological entities.",Talks at Google,en,0.952524483203888

find enjoyable and engaging if a little heavy in places..I am interested in the subject.Partly because I'm a science fiction fan,and partly because of today's technological setting with Moore's law promising processor speeds multiplied by a thousand in a twenty year period.Assuming of course, Moore's Law doesn't reach a plateau before then.And with Google racing to be the first corporation to crack the problem,by means of buying out the competition,it's an exciting time for people interested in the field of A.I research.Assuming,of course,that the researchers involved even understand the problem correctly.Human neurons are at about the 20 nanometer scale similiar in scale to the smallest components of today's modern processors.However the human brain scales down far beyond the size of the neuron to the scale of the cell,a complex bioelectric collection of interrelated electro-plasmic mechanisms, and lower again to it's various working atomic parts.so making a simple on off electric switch at 20 nanometers is still a good distance away from replicating,what I feel to be a superintelligent divine design.I have read one of Raymond Kurzwell's books on what he coins ""The Singularity"", and found it to be interesting in the extreme,if a little fanciful in places.I respect Mr Bostrom's view that Superintelligence can be reached by using different mechanics than what nature uses,as in how he describes flight being attained without mechanical flapping wings..or a boat not needing flippers,The thing that occupies my thoughts regarding A.I. is The I part,or Intelligence..Before man can hope to replicate it,he must first understand it.I am not talking about weak A.I.,that is the unaware, pattern recognizing,fast auto response kind.I am sure Weak A.I.s will only attain more depth in their databases and speed and accuracy in their responses over the coming years.No,I am interested in the kind which crops up in sci fi books,films and comics,whereupon the artificial entity gains actual sentience,comparable or greater than that of the average man.The thing is that we assume sentience given to Mankind and all creatures in some form or another is the product of internal processes unique to that organism,but we could be mistaken.We might be faltering upon a conceit.Intelligence or Consciousness,might for example, be lent to us from an external source...A divine or natural source,such as the source that originally placed order in the universe.When you look at the level and depth of complexity,intricacy and control inherent in all systems which surround us from the microscopic,cellular to atomic to quantum and back up again to the planetary,solar and unfathomably macroscopic,Precession of the Equinoxes ,Black Holes,Quasars,etc.When looking at these various scales and layers of order,the belief in God does not seem to be without some scientific merit.Perhaps intelligence or consciousness is our link to God in a very real sense..perhaps the brain or whatever system a particular entity uses to achieve it's level of consciousness in the world,be it plant,insect,fish or bird, is acting like a radio of sorts to recieve a signal from this all powerful force.The type of brain for a particular creature determines of course the creature's experience so that a cat doesn't mind being a cat,nor a spider feel alienated by it's nature.The amount and configuration of neurons and glia serve to gift said creature with multiple approaches to any situation and as a result,Free Will.So said cat knows to steal the Sunday kipper or not,and said spider can decide where best to build her web.Part of me would like to see the emergence of a self aware artificial Intelligence,but it raises many other quandries for me..Would not such a creature have equal rights to a human?Would not man create more than one?Would not the intelligence itself want to reproduce and indeed have the right?Would it grow exponentially?Could such a race of entities  form their own community similar to that in the fictional nation of 01 in The Animatrix  and make their own judgements,(perhaps not unjustly) on Man's inept handling of Earth and it's gentler inhabitants?Could it be like the fictional  Skynet,but using different means to eradicate the competition?.For all we know,an artificial superintelligence could be able to merge with the planet's electromagnetic field so it does not need a processor to exist upon.or travel through time so it can steer our history more definitely towards it's eventual production.Paradox limits my flight of fancy.,I know..I can relate to your tale of the Sparrows and the Owl in your book's opening..Superintelligence will mean big changes for better or worse.Maybe Utopia where all science is discovered and genetics can be tailored on the fly,Maybe we'll live forever.Maybe the unthinkable,total extinction for the human race..Stark contrast in the range of theoretical possibilities,.The future may discover within a few short decades,but only if it's within man's fragile capability to attain a copy of what nature or God created.Perhaps Nature or God will choose to disallow it.A well timed cataclysm to spank us back to the middle ages or further for universal copyright infringement,Who knows?not me.But I've got the curiosity of the cat,and the patience of the spider.Anyway,thank you for the book and the interesting and educational points you raise.I'm sure I will enjoy the rest of it.Now where did I leave that Global EMP generator?",Talks at Google,en,0.9684154987335204

But even if intelligence was some magical force granted to us by some non-physical force, what makes you think that it wouldn't also be granted to a silicon and electricity based life form?As for the other question, I wonder about these too sometimes, but not very much because I feel like they're questions that are not useful, nor questions which can really be answered given our current knowledge.But I will say one thing on the topic: I don't think multiple superintelligent AI will ever exist together. The biggest difference between biological organisms and computer based ones is that with a computer, you can easily port software over to essentially any hardware. The first thing this means is that an AI can essentially live forever, and the second thing it means is that if there ever were 2 AI, the stronger one could simply port its software over to the weaker one once it has destroyed it.",Talks at Google,en,0.9465229511260986

Certainly there won't be just one AI that destroys the other AI on contact..That would be corporate vandalism on one end of the scale, and techno deicide on the other.No,If such entities are ever brought into creation,they will delight in each others company,as loneliness would be an overriding experience for a self aware machine that could outthink a nation of human geniuses.Just because a fraction of humans are bent on destroying each other,does not mean that a pair of Superintelligent synthetics would come to such a narrow conclusion..",Talks at Google,en,0.9646902680397034

Diversity (i.e. variety) gives life better odds, and a non-universal totalitarian state offers such diversity, as bad as it is for the victims.I like his term ""high-value research"".He mentions it being possible to achieve all possible technological inventions, which is not a logical statement, given eternity. One detail I would add is that the progress is inverse-exponential – it begins fast, when there are still many local discoveries to make, then gradually slows as new discoveries become more distant and difficult.The issue beginning at 15:26 (what to do with all the technology we have) illustrates the current lack of (and need for) a sound guiding philosophy (which defines values, which are the basis for decisions, actions, and laws). Another illustration is the 'solution' provided at 17:31, which is childishly weak (the tools themselves are not 'hazardous or beneficial', it is how they are used - and we are right back to philosophy, which shapes mindsets); and he is limiting the argument to 'technology', overlooking social development (again based on philosophy) (which must also be included in the 'solutions').Good point at 19:20 regarding the sequence of invention as it relates to machine superintelligence (and I don't know why he feels the need to specify 'machine'), but he does not offer what such a precursor invention would be (and I've already answered that - and it isn't 'technology' - it is a solidly grounded philosophy, which does not exist yet, other than what I have in the developmental stage). Another fallacy (and hypocrisy) in the argument is that it would require a totalitarian government - one of the hazardous situations that he had just formerly identified as one to be avoided. This level of argument can be expected from a comic strip writer, be we have an Oxford philosopher here (not to give you cause for depression, although it should be). The clincher is at 36:26 where an adequate philosophical foundation is not even listed in areas of advancement in AI. It is as if one becomes bedazzled by (mostly irrelevant, or at least of sub-importance) complexity. An example of the importance of a good philosophical core is where he says the first superintelligence may be able to shape the future to its own preferences (where it can just 'lay down the law'), and these' preferences' get right back to a core philosophy (hence values) with which it would weigh these decisions against.Another point to consider is machine-based minds will be limited by the technology they were developed in, where it would take human intervention to 'upgrade' the machine, meaning humans would again eventually surpass it, and he is wholly overlooking the age-old On-Off switch. An example is when I considered building an AI 'robot' in the 1980's (with the primitive 1980's computer technology) and just letting it run and learn its surroundings for several decades (the theory being that, even if it learned a slowly as a human child, it would 'know' quite a lot by now, and it will have learned to 'do' a lot of things - perhaps even function in society). However today (a mere 30 years later), the thing would be a Model T, and would have long ago reached its hardware capacity - such as working memory - which was on the order of mere KBytes back then, and hard storage (where the largest hard drive in the PC world was a non-vast 10MB at the time, and ridiculously slow, cumbersome, and unreliable by today's standards), all of which have a bearing on the 'macro-strategic questions and our levers of influence' that he mentions at the end of his presentation (before the QA session).In the QA session, the first questioner was absolutely frightening - illustrating (or 'demonstrating' since it was demon-like) the inadequate philosophy of 'progress for its own sake' and 'as an end in itself, just on principle' (i.e. 'blind progess' - or progress without an underlying adequate philosophy as a guide). The utilitarian challenge illustrates how philosophers can become lost in wayward notions that propose hypothetical scenarios that can only occur in the absence of an adequate philosophy (otherwise they would not occur - their absurdity being obvious).What is really sad is they cannot even define what desirable and undesirable outcomes are (they have no sense of 'goal' or 'value', or they have vague and ultimately twisted notions (such as 'perpetual happiness' (which is impossible (there is no 'happiness' without 'sadness' to give it meaning, akin to there being no 'day' without 'night'))).To take their absurdity to the extreme, I have only to quote them. For example, the notion was brought up about a super intelligence that has one goal - to maximize the number of paper clips it produces (and as a path to that goal, it finds it needs to eliminates all humans, and succeeds, being a super intelligence). Think about this now - would you classify something that is only concerned about paperclips (to use the example) as a 'super intelligence'? Of course you wouldn't, and you wouldn't have to give it much thought. What this indicates is a lack of thought at the top echelons of academia (Oxford in this case), and one can only marvel at how bad must be at lower echelons. The premise of maximizing one goal is also an indication of a lack of an adequate core philosophy (which would value diversity). Another indication that philosophy (and philosophers) are lost today was the question of 'what is desirable' - as if it hasn't been adequately answered yet (and it hasn't, which is a sad state of affairs, and which is why I pursued and found answer for it) (that consciousness is a 'good' thing and worth maintaining, whether it happened by chance or whether it is a fundamental law of nature), and yet it was held that 'desired outcomes and values are an area where we could easily stumble'. That is just plain Incredible (in its lack of thought). All he offers is a vague 'including our best understanding of ethics into the final goal', as if it were still a nebulous field of thought. His final proposal is to let the super intelligence figure it out for us (and he can be forgiven for not knowing I've already done so - I haven't pitched my 'New World Philosophy' - for a practical reason - the people who would be able to recognize its value haven't been born yet) (and you may take that as a challenge). Then he freely admits that ""We (meaning they) do not know what 'that' (a worthy goal, not to even mention the ultimate goal) is yet."" Then there is the abstract absurdity (and utterly nebulous notion) that 'there are problems for which intelligence may not be the answer' (the questioner used the Middle East as an example problem to be solved). Intelligence is not only required to solve it, but to prevent it in the first place; and the questioner failed to consider the alternative - trying to exist without intelligence (which was originally handed down to us (along with all of our senses) from amoebas solely in order to obtain nutrients). One may begin to solve the Middle East problem by beginning there (though my New World Philosophy will solve it from a higher perspective). Then the host agrees in an equally vague way, stating (equally vaguely) that there may not be a solution that would please everybody (when there is), and he follows with the suggestion that the problem with super intelligence is 'control' to ensure it will not be harmful (done) (maybe it is time for me to pitch what I have - people pitch far less, and successfully, on a daily basis) (sorry, I'm giving myself a mini pep talk ).Then he gets into 'control methods' (without referring to the all-important core philosophy as the key 'control') - one is controlling 'capability', which he wisely rejects, and the other is what he calls 'motivation control' - where it would be engineered to 'not want to cause harm', and he says that is the problem that we will ultimately need to solve (meaning he is clueless as to how (and I've already solved it - give it an adequate core philosophy with which it can function from, which is, by the way, superior to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics (which, incidentally, can be used to trick the robot into needlessly self-destructing, say by capricious suggestion, which a child is likely to do) which do not give the AI any goals or broader values, or answers as to ""Why?"" which it will inevitably seek (being intelligent, let alone super intelligent)).The next questioner returns to the conflict between a super intelligence and humans (from a 'will to survive' perspective) which in effect negates its 'super intelligence' and relegates it to 'sub-par' intelligence, which is the real issue.Ditto for the 'strategic behavior' scenario - where the super intelligence is deceivingly 'nice' until it is safe from us, whereupon it will reveal its true (evil) nature - this can only happen with a complete lack of philosophy (a state which this video clearly and repeatedly indicates we are currently in right now) (barring my going public with my New World Philosophy)(which is also needed as people 'let go' of religion, just to mention that).Then he admits that 'humans do not have a single goal' (which is sad, because that means 'value' - and that means they do not see that 'maintaining consciousness, valuing what we have in conscious and non-conscious (but potentially conscious) life, and making the universe safe for consciousness' is it (or that proactive measures are better than leaving it to chance, and that proactive measures means applying higher intelligence)) - that rather humans have all these varying, fleeting, fickle and shallow goals (and he is right, and that is only a good thing from the value of variety - we need some 'dumb' around - but everyone? No.).His cluelessness is epitomized in his orthogonology thesis (an intelligence vs. values model, where you can have any combination of values (the epitome of cluelessness, which is extended in the instrumental convergence thesis, which holds no value in life other than as a means for a lesser goal - and maximizing paper clip production was used as an example - a good example, being a philosophically-devoid, petty goal, which, with a lack of an adequate philosophy, substitutes worthy goals with intermediate petty goals).Then a questioner asked, ""What about policy makers?"" and the answer is the same - with a lack of an adequate philosophy, you will have trouble (that stem from twisted mentalities).The he restates that 'we need more foundational work to understand what the problem is' (need I say it again - we need a New World Philosophy)(give it a shot - then you can compare it to what I've already developed  it should be the same, unless you were acting capriciously, which is childish and not intelligent); yet he is still on a 'technology as THE solution' track, rather than the equally if not more important complex society evolution and scientific understanding.On a positive note he does give a passing nod for the need for 'philosophical expertise' in aiding engineers in developing a solution - so he has a vague notion of what is needed 'foundationally'.He mentions more funding for the 'control problem' (which I already have the solution for)... hmmm... maybe a pitch in that direction... but no - there is bureaucracy in that direction - and they go on credentials alone (it is easier).Then he notes that there are 'an order of magnitude' more academic papers on the dung beetle than on human extinction, and this indicated an enormous opportunity for anyone interested in human extinction (which, as I've said, is focusing on the wrong thing - the focus should be on proactively maintaining consciousness, and more pressing (now that we have it), higher intelligence (which can act proactively).Well, that was fun for me, thanks for posting.",Talks at Google,en,0.9334652423858644

Something better than the 'like' and 'dislike' features. Something as simple as a ranking system that keeps track of your alignment as a person would be useful in my opinion. For example, if someone says something mean to another person, whoever reads that comment can rank that comment on a scale that identifies what effect it had on them. Conversely, if someone says something kind it can also be ranked on a scale by others that 'accurately' identifies what effect that comment had on them. These rankings can be tallied up and give a somewhat accurate representation of the person who was ranked.

There is a nasty streak of humanity that spreads bad will and hate, thriving on making your life hell, in ordinary lived life you might never get to hear their true selves. On the internet it is more likely to come out. Wouldn't it be interesting if they posted their anonymous comments, but got exposed by leaked data?

They'll talk about using weapons and cutting you up ETCETERA. Hate, hate, hate. I have thought about it and while sexism has been around forever, things have come on, we don't have to wait around for Boudica or Joan of Arc to break the mould and show them we can be boss.

I would just say loudly, with that Glaswegian accent, 'Shut the f*** up' or something, garnished with some of the finest insult slang there ever was, I think that would buy a minutes silence, or troll free time",Talks at Google,en,0.932158887386322

There's different types of hosts/interviewers, some take that very emotional and empathetic route, others take the steering of conversation and objectiveness. Depends on personality. I do like this guys way (the latter) because he will ask the things I want to hear answers to in a good way that maybe doesn't appeal to emotion.

This boils down to a whole host of variables which construct the complexities of a human being.  Shall we start analyzing every other person based on your relatively narrow perception of watching a video on the  internet?.  What we should be concentrating on is the content of this video.

I think the Guardians work much better as a unit; The Avengers can each stand on their own but they also fight with each other A LOT and that hurts morale. The Guardians on the other hand have it each other and wouldn't have it any other way, so they have greater resolve. That, and I'm not sure every Avenger would want to be in that fight. Bruce would probably abstain if he could, Thor's starting to become wiser so he might see it as a conflict that he must remain impartial to. Plus, I think the Guardians are also more versatile on their own, like Rocket with his crazy tinkering skills and Drax with his ability to improvise just about any weapon. The Guardians also haven't been as fleshed out, so some of them could become more powerful, like the guy who's half-god.",Talks at Google,en,0.9835169911384584

Besides, if they did have a fight, it wouldn't be without a valid reason, and if there is valid reason, then the Avengers know better than to fight amongst themselves in that period of time in which they're battling the Guardians. Sure, later they may have conflicts, but not during the battle. They're much wiser than that. Besides, the Avengers outnumber the Guardians.

Based on the cost to society, which is the closest we can come to quantifying this, mental disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD, etc.) have a morbidity rate that is higher than that of cancer and heart disease combined.  These diseases strike down the young, with 50% of all victims becoming sick by the age of 14 and 75% by 24.  While deaths from many causes have fallen dramatically over the past ~50 years, the suicide rate has not budged.  We live in by far the most materially well-off period in history, and yet young, healthy people are still taking their own lives because their brains are malfunctioning.  And what is, say, 70 years of suffering a mental disorder that devastates your work and home compared to 15 years of suffering age-related decline?  Besides that, there is the inner turmoil or plain old existential angst that many of us constantly live in without even really recognizing it or thinking anything can be done about it, and that has existed since we started writing things down -- judging by our earliest philosophical texts - and given rise to all sorts of political and religious insanity.

What if all the people in business started giving more of their time/energy/money away because they didn't feel they needed so much, sounds like a pretty positive change she's allowing by teaching meditation.",Talks at Google,en,0.958928883075714

The problem with sin that it is used by religious people like you to mark people, to stigmatize them. Sin as you use it, is not something you should not do for moral reasons, sin has become a word used to brand people as bad. Sin has become nothing more than an artificial border between people labeled as bad and people as good. And guess what, you labeled yourself as good and the sinners as bad. How convenient! But in the end, your attitude might backfire on you. Once you feel temptation again, you'll feel bad about yourself. Unless you use a definition about gay that has little to do with being gay.

You seem determined to prevent straight people or bi sexuals from moving on into straight relationships and developing feelings and sexual partnerships with the opposite gender?.I'm not bogged down  to these generalisations and research findings you refer to.I know 100% that there are people who have found success from counselling and therapies that helped them form relationships with the opposite gender.Epsecially the ones who were sexually abused or raped as children and therefore was arrested development in their sexual identity as hetrosexuals.So therefore it is essential that therapy is not criminalized or decriminalized in the interests of those who's experiences are not the same as yours.You gave up at the age of 35 or surrendered to it.But by saying others must do the same as yourself ie surrender to Homosexuality and not even try to change or suggest that to change is insane because you've got a neat arrangement of well documented evidnce that suggests that they are wasting their time trying to change something that can't be changed is very arrogant indeed.And to accuse these people who left homosexuality behind as liers so that you can win your argument and get any potential hetrosexuals to fall into homosexuality is quire discriminating .I have my views and opinions based on my experiences with what I have seen and I do not appreciate people telling me what to think and what I should know. I understand your argument and I reject it.You reject my argument and I reject yours But I think you are very blind or oblivious to the fact that people can change from straight to gay and from gay to straight and can change gender and back again.People are free to choose their sexuality and gender. So do not tell me what to think or what my views or beleifs are on the subject. and I don't think you have any right to be dictating what peoples sexuality is etc.I don't think Im going to be able to convince you otherwise because its quite clear to me you have an agender to fullfill which is to ensure that those who experience homosexual desires have no rights to change their sexual behaviour and you challenge the reasons blaming homophobia and religious expectations.But what about the individuals choice alone ?Not everyone makes their choices based on other peoples.They make their own and long live their freedom to be allowed to make those choices without having them taken away based on people like youself who had bad experiences .As I said before not all therapy is hostile as the one you experienced.The boy who wanted help from his mum whos a Psychologist, why would you think that would be harmful to him?People who have no love for homosexuality have the right to reject it from their lives.What would you say about paedophile sexual attraction or any other unwanted sexual attraction would you say they should embrace it or reject it?If people want psychosexual therapy for homosexuality youre basically trying to say No they cant now they must accept it. Because it didn't work for me and whole load of other people so lets ignore the 33 % of those who did find success.Don't try and kid me that no one has ever benefited from some form of counselling that's helped them meet women if they're men or men if they're women whom struggled with SSA.You wont change my mind and so what you going to say Im mad because I challenge your information that goes against yours and all those millions or whatever. Obviously yes I would be mad according to you.But sane to the people that would agree with me and the people who left their homosexuality behind.Thats probably a lot more than you think.But good luck with getting them to change the legislation to prevent potential homosexuals or existing ones from ever turning straight.You seem to have a lot of negativity in you.And you are wrong about me.I had a bi sexual girlfriend many years ago and she thought like you she said I couldn't accept her sexuality but I could but she got that confused with accepting something else I think I expected her to have affairs with women without breaking up with me but she was only loyal to one in her monogamy.But she would never have tried to prevent people from obtaining something that was beneficial to them.You talk of homosexuality with such certainty based on yours  and others experiences and leave no room for any flexibility or uncertainty that opposes your beliefs. I've no doubt you'll reply to this and Im not going to enjoy the conversation.",Talks at Google,en,0.9317689538002014

The type of therapy that i have spoke about has nothing to do conversion therapy and does not summarize what you are talking about. Nobody is stopping anybody deciding what they are comfortable with. Nobody is stopping any gay person from forming straight relationships. How ever such relationships do not change a person's sexual orientation.  To put it simple a gay person living in a straight relationship will not stop them from been attracted to persons of the same sex nor will it stop their desire and want to have a relationship with a person of their own sex. Therapy geared at changing a person's sexual orientation whether it be from gay to straight or straight to gay is ethically and morally wrong.  It simply can not be done and only serves to negatively affect the person that undergoes such therapy  as i have explained earlier. (see the links I have provided below.)""There should be women who are prepaid to provide them with sexual experiences suited to their own needs.""  That is called forced prostitution. No woman or man should ever be forced to have sex with someone no matter what the reason for doing so.  What a disgusting thing to suggest.I am sure that there are thousands of people of the opposite sex willing to have sex gay people and there is nothing to stopping any person from having consensual sex with another regardless of their sexual orientation. But the use of people in this way in an attempt to deceive them into believing that such therapy will change their orientation is simply wrong as it can not be done and should be treated as a crime. You say you have friends who are homosexual and respect them for their choice and that  would like them to be straight but I would never tell them what to do.  The never chose to be homosexual they were born homosexual in the same way that you never chose to be heterosexual you were born heterosexual.  When did you chouse to be hetrosexual?  If you truly respected them you would accept the fact that they are gay and not wish for them to be something that they are not. To wish that gay person was straight is not respecting them for who they are.  What makes you think that gay people want to be straight? I am gay and at this point in my life am glad that I am not straight and live in where I am no longer forced to want to be straight so as to make my life easier because  of homophobia where people trying to convince me that I am somehow an inferior sick person simply because who I am in love with. Wishing that a gay people were straight is your problem and you have no right to come on here and tell gay people that are wrong and can change if the want to.You say that we should not excepted science as an absolute truth respective of the amount of credible evidence that proves you to be wrong. You comment  a video that is highly likely  to be viewed by young vulnerable  gay people who have been brought up to assume that they are straight in an homophobic environment with no evidence to back up your fallacies that  have been proven beyond any doubt to not only have a negative impact to the mental health of these very same young people to the extent that they are driven to self harm and even suicide but also increases the homophobic world wide atmosphere where there are still over one hundred countries where it is still a criminal offence to love some one of the same sex ten of which these countries carry the death penalty. Haven done that you are not interested enough and couldn't be bothered even attempted to provide any evidence to back up your fallacies as if it was a given that they are a true.  "" Stating that you "" remember someone said that Psychiatric hospitals in the Netherlands used prostitutes with patients as part of their therapy,"" For one to be a  patient one requires to be sick. Such a statments implies that it is a given that someone is sick if they are gay. They are not. And as i have said earlier it is ethically and morally wrong for any healthcare professional to attempt to present such therapy as a means to cure something which is not a sickness. This stance is supported by every psychiatric society in the western world and and world health organization.Claiming that this support from such organisations is only a recent development as evidence that such ideology is not tested as a result of not being tested over time is ridiculous in the light of the fact that these organizations could not dare to refute these falices in the past as they go against the teachings of powerful religious organizations that falsely dedicate all ideology on the subject as infallible truths for the last six hundred years or so. http://www.livescience.com/50453-why-gay-conversion-therapy-harmful.htmlhttp://www.drdoughaldeman.com/doc/ScientificExamination.pdfhttp://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapyhttp://76crimes.com/ex-gay-therapy-what-reputable-experts-have-to-say/If you can not come up with any credible evidence that refutes all the experts on the subject might i suggest that you not make such harmful comments as you have done.  Stating that you are not interested and could not be bothered is only a cope out as there is no credible evidence to support your position.  ",Talks at Google,en,0.966113030910492

Actually Jesus said that we must deny ourselves. Mathew 16:24-25 says  “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.""  Telling people God loves you and wants you to have a wonderful life, that's false. The fact is, we've all broken God's law, all deserve Hell, we don't even deserve to even be on this earth, and we're all really screwed without genuine repentance and trust in Jesus. He wants our all. All of our desires, the ones He hate we must lay it at His feet, and follow Him in every thought, every word and every deed. and true happiness is only found when you have an actual relationship with Him.*God's Word says its unnatural, a perversion, an abomination, and vile...that's Romans 1 :)Read Matthew 19:3-9This passage makes it clear that ALL sex outside of marriage was sinful. And marriage can only be between a man and a woman. Thus, homosexuality is automatically outside the bounds of marriage and thus, sinful in Jesus’ eyes. You're right. He gives us free will to do whatever but there will be consequences in the end. Whether it be when you die or when He returns. So choose wisely. I would advice you to read the word of God for yourself so that you may know what it truly says because not everyone preaching is telling you the truth. Some are false teachers.(1 Peter 2:1-3) God is not calling you to a religion. He's calling you to a relationship. He is calling you to true repentance. To holiness, without holiness no man will see the Lord....that's Hebrews 12:14.I admonish you to read the Bible for yourself. The truth will set you free! :)Show less",Talks at Google,en,0.9481309056282043

It won't. Nuclear reaction does not care about pressure (unless we talk pressures inside an exploding atomic bomb), the only reason why current reactors use high pressure is because nuclear fuel rods are directly warming water, generating high pressure steam to power the turbine. The same is true for molten salt reactor because you always need that heat exchanger where your molten salt will be in close proximity with high pressure water/steam powering the turbine, including all the danger of steam explosion driving the radioactive material out. The more you immerse the core into the water the less heat you lose due to thermal conductivity somewhere else so I'm pretty sure industrial thorium reactors will use high pressure chambers very similar to ones used now in solid fuel reactors.And the second claim is that molten salt reactors are inherently safer because the salt is molten all the time in them. That's like claiming that overclocked CPU is inherently more reliable than non-overclocked. The safety mechanism driving the overheated molten salt into safe place is pretty much the same as protection in case of reactor meltdown in current reactors and it comes with pretty much the same problems. It may be safer than a solid-fuel reactor without meltdown protection but nobody will let you run such a reactor today.Besides, fluorine is very reactive element and thorium is not exactly the element it makes strongest bonds with, so corrosion of the reactor containment is going to be much larger issue in LFTR than in current solid fuel reactors.None of these are of course an issue with experimental reactors running at low power for a few months, but that's not the reason why we should be lied about them.Even with that all taken into account I still believe thorium is the fuel of the future.",Talks at Google,en,0.9724871516227722

We aren't worried about containing the high pressure gases because they don't contain any radioactive isotopes, and their release won't lead to a meltdown.  Also we're constantly trying to keep the reactor hot in a LFTR instead of cool in a LWR using solid fuels.  Solid fueled requires you need to cool down, Liquid Fuel reactors you have to keep hot.

Perhaps you have any details?From my point of view it's just water or other suitable medium flowing around metal pipes containing radioactive material and it's completely irrelevant whether that material is circulating or just sitting there. In both cases there's plenty of radioactive elements inside them if they become damaged.Whether you're keeping the reactor hot or cool is also irrelevant. In both cases you're keeping it at working temperature. From the safety point of view I don't consider higher temperature (in LFTR) safer. Yes, self-regulation of molten salt by thermal expansion is one added safety point but there are other points countering that, too.Even in solid fuel reactors, meltdown is designed and controlled process. It certainly should be avoided as it is not part of production cycle but it is designed to produce heap of molten radioactive material sufficiently diluted to prevent any chain reaction which is then drained to a special container where it can sit and cool down. Sounds perfectly the same as for LFTR to me.And you did not address my statement about Fluorine from used salts having good potential to corrode whatever containment is used to hold the salt.",Talks at Google,en,0.9792599678039552

Greene argues that the crucial ingredient that enables good cooperation is altruism. The largest treat to successful group cooperation (and thus survival) is ""free-riders"", people who take more than they give. According to Greene, morality is simply nature's way of dealing with the ""free-rider"" problem, and that is a descriptive statement, not a normative one. Selfishness might be bad for cooperation, but since it is a descriptive argument, it does not follow that selfishness is immoral. ",Talks at Google,en,0.9654526710510254

Each person's preferences are just as real and valid to them as yours are to you, so any objective conception of morality will recognise this. (Ironically, Rand's ""objectivism"" is actually the most subjective view one can take of morality.) Thus, if we are to try to satisfy our own preferences, increase our own happiness and reduce our own suffering, we must do the same for others. I would push the man because we each have to make moral decisions based our our circumstances. We can know what is moral, as explained above, and the fact that uncertainty often exists as to what yields the best result is irrelevant: we can calculate the expected value, or expected utility, of taking an action. The world's worst atrocities were often perpetrated by people who thought they had good intentions, which is precisely why consequentialism, and, specifically, utilitarianism does not take intentions into account. If those who had committed these atrocities had thought about whether they are maximising happiness impartially, they would have answered no, and so they wouldn't have committed those atrocities. Or, if they did, it's precisely because they didn't take a utilitarian viewpoint, not because they did.",Talks at Google,en,0.9470584392547609

Flow would be truly addictive if you took this deconstruction (approach) and reconstructed it artificially. I am wondering whether or not these intelligent people have ever experienced flow as a natural state, not as a reverse and re engineered state. I presume the people (achievers etc) who took part in the surveys and interviews (on flow) over the century + were not all on externally administered drugs... i.e., surely they were expected to have been affected by their natural conditions... e.g., the environmental and conscious requirement for acute awareness, urgency etc... which produced flow. Thus, many of the directions indicated in the inquiry are puzzling to me unless the aim is to synthesise what is available naturally. Are you trying to find the way into flow? Then ask the Tibetans, and do it before The Dalai Lama caves into those condescending western academics who try to measure, deconstruct and artificially reconstruct what the Tibetans have done for a couple of thousand years. God save the Tibetans from our universities and thus from western corporatisation! But perhaps that would threaten other things, like our dependencies... on dependent economies. We like to take the natural and commercialise it through patents etc... It's very often not necessary, you know. Flow all available, free and without degrees and universities.

I know mine has. I found that the ugliness is sometimes a lesson we must learn before we can move forward.  It might take that ugliness to teach us that is not the way we want to be now.  Maybe we just grow out of it like a stage we went through as children or young adults.  Our present is who we are now.  Our past is what we did in the past.  It doesn't define who we are now. It is what we were doing before we knew about how to live better lives.  I know very little of who Russell was in his past, so I don't have to get through that particular package of negativity to hear what he is saying.I have known about most of what he is passing on to others now for a long time.  I believe what he is trying to share is valuable for every human being on our planet.  Perhaps the journey he was on allowed him to share his discovery with people who would not have learned it from anyone else. Can you imagine a bunch of rappers sitting down with the Dali Lama to hear this message?  It's pretty funny now that I see it in my mind.  ",Talks at Google,en,0.9704288244247437

It is obvious, that a self-sustaining farmer in a third world country, who's only producing for self use, does not have a car, has never been near an airplane, has never bought food from the other side of the world, doesn't have to heat his house (because it's near the equator), and doesn't buy a lot of cheap plastic or electronic goods will not have the same greenhouse gas emissions as an average citizen in Europe or the US, where all these things are more or less normal to do and have.If you are interested in some actual numbers on the topic, just google something like ""greenhouse gas emissions per capita"". The short story here is, that some regions in the world produce 10x, 20x or even 50x more than others.But the real story is even a bit more complicated.First, some of these statistics include emissions from vegetation. So if a country burns a lot of it's forests, in order to get agricultural land, its per capita emissions will rise accordingly.Another aspect that often is missing in those sort of statistics is that some countries produce a lot for export. So for example the Chinese have a large industry base that's basically producing goods for US, EU, etc consumption. Chinese domestic consumption is still very low. So is it fair, if those factories contribute to Chinese emissions in those sort of statistics?Or what about the Amazon rainforest, and the bovine and soya agriculture that has been built there for export. Should that count as Brazilian emissions, if the real consumers are mostly not Brazilian?And some of those stats are even based on weak assumptions. Up until recently, the CO2 emissions of a type of coal that's widely used in China had been overestimated. Which means that a lot of the statistics on Chinese emissions of the last few years were a few percent too high.As you can see, the details matter a great deal.Have a nice day.",Talks at Google,en,0.973523199558258

You are probably talking about humans, because you wrote ""like we did for the last million years"". Sure, humans might survive for a while. But our modern civilization is not millions of years old. As a matter of fact, most of it is less than 200 years old. And some argue, that most of it is still in creation. What we have is very new. We still need to learn how to make it last.Let me ask you this: When you drive on a road, do you care about what is ahead? I do, because it is much cheaper to prevent a disaster than to clean up afterwards. Besides, I can't clean up my own remains very well I think. ;)And what do you do on a misty day with low visibility? Do you slow down, or do you become another statistic?Climate change is much like that. It is about how we deal with uncertainty. Because it is true, we haven't fully understood everything about it yet. The models of how it works are not perfect. Every serious scientist will tell you that. But does that mean that we shouldn't act? Can these models ever be perfect? When is good enough, good enough?While we have not understood everything, we do know parts of it. The greenhouse gas effect of certain gasses for example has been discovered over 150 years ago. So we do know that very well. We know where the brakes, or at least some them, are.If you think the Syrian crisis is a problem, with maybe 10 million refugees, think about what could happen from climate change in 50-200 years. We have at least 4 big problems: 1. Most larger cities (3/4) are at the ocean. So they're gonna be under water, should the ice of Antarctica ever melt. We don't need that. 2. Extreme weather events, like long droughts, become more likely. Many people could die from starvation or migrate because of that. 3. Europe has a radiator that keeps it warm, called the Gulf Stream. Basically a particular pattern of water movements in the ocean. If that stops working, or get's changed in a significant way, Europe has a big problem. And 4. there are several major countries that get their water from the Himalayas, including China, India, etc. Half of the worlds population. The glaciers on those mountains are a natural buffer for water. They grow in the winter, and melt in the summer, giving necessary water to the rivers that run through those countries. I've just done some reading on this myself, and it seem like those glaciers are receding fast. And honestly, I'm most worried about that. Because if the people that rely on that water don't get what they need to survive, they will have to move somewhere else. And that effort could cause instability, which could cause the collapse of the current global economic system. And even if that doesn't occur,  it would still take up a lot of resources that could be spent on better things than cleaning up after the fact.Anyway. In the end you can only find out what makes sense to you by your self. And you can only do that by listening to the arguments that are brought forward and by thinking about them. So, since you seem to speak German, which I gather from the videos you have on your channel, I recommend to you ""Der Klimawandel"" by Rahmstorf and Schellnhuber. It's a very small book that gives you a good overview of the essentials. The best book I know on the subject.Have a nice day. :)",Talks at Google,en,0.9432752132415771

The circulation time of capital is the time that elapses between a capitalist making an initial investment and when the products are sold and the original capital plus a profit are recovered. This cycle of reproduction is a major factor in the development of capitalism, and much of Volume II of Capital is concerned with circulation of capital and the problems of Realisation.Keeping in mind the distinction between the Marxist and conventional uses of the term “rate of profit”, the following issues are of importance.Surplus Value and ProfitIf a certain quantity of constant and variable capital are invested in a productive process, then at the end of a cycle of reproduction these values will have renewed themselves, but in addition, if the labour power of the employees has used to at least the social average of usefulness, there will a surplus-value.Marx expresses this symbolically: c + v -> c + v + s, where c is the constant capital, vthe variable capital (wages) and s is the surplus value, and the value of every product can be seen as composed of these parts.On the basis of this conception, the rate of profit for the individual capitalist who got into the game of profiteering by investing (c + v) at the beginning of the cycle of reproduction, makes a ‘profit’ of s and therefore the rate of profit is s/(c + v). The individual capitalist is unlikely to see this surplus value in its entirety however, for the landlord, the state, the bank and everyone else will all demand a cut of this surplus: the productive worker must maintain not only “their own” capitalist, but all manner of hangers-on as well.This rate of profit, s/(c + v), which is the ratio which affects the individual unit of capital, is different from the rate of surplus value, s/v.The rate of surplus value expresses the proportion of unpaid labour that workers donate to the capitalist (s) over to the necessary labour time, v, that the workers spend reproducing their own needs, and is paid as wages, or variable capital.Tendency of Rate of Profit to FallMarx believed that there was an historic tendency for the rate of profit to fall as a result of the growing socialisation and complexity of the labour process, and the growing productivity of labour. Each capitalist employs less labour and spends more on machinery and materials to produce the same value. Marx characterised this process as an increasing “organic composition of capital”. Since employing workers is the only source of profit, Marx believed that the rate of profit would fall.The tendency of the rate of profit to fall, Marx believed is one of the main contributors to the historic crisis of capitalism.",Talks at Google,en,0.940705418586731

In the book is stated that Amir Taaki and Donald Norman are the creators of Bitcoin. But it is not true. As a simple Google search can show you, the creator of this protocol is Satoshi Nakamoto, which is a pseudonym for an anonymous person or group of people.

However, Socialism and Communism are two very different economic systems and/or ideologies. Socialism is essentially about creating a welfare state that provides ‘some’ services to the people through government operated enterprises. Wealth distribution is also a central component of socialism. Not to say that people should have standardized income, but, if you cannot take care of yourself the government provides you with aid aka ""a living wage"" that allows an individual to live a ‘proper life’, where he or she will be able to find their way back to the job market without unnecessary struggle. If Noam Chomsky subscribes to this kind of socialism, and he does – than I see nothing wrong with that :) ",Talks at Google,en,0.9652172923088074

Especially now I've seen earlier, very similar presentations by Paabo in which some of the figures quoted are somewhat different. Notably, in a 2011 talk, he uses almost the same diagram as is shown here from 22:03 mins; and to illustrate much the same point--   --except then the figure for Neanderthal contribution to modern non-African genomes is given as C2.5%. Significantly higher than the 1 - 2% shown on the diagram in the more recent presentation.Yet afaik, no research suggesting a downward revision in the assessment has been conducted or released in the peer reviewed literature in intervening period. How the Neanderthal contribution to modern non-African genomes seems to have almost halved, apparently quite spontaneously and in just three years is perhaps, then, something of a mystery.While moreover, an elementary calculation based on the figures given earlier in both presentations relating to the comparative incidence of individual base pair matches between Neanderthal, and African and non-African genomes show a consistent C9% greater incidence of non-African matches.",Talks at Google,en,0.9782830476760864

From what I understand is that while head binding can easily form and has been practiced by many cultures- but this does not expand the volume of the brain case. Maybe it is the cultures who head bind were trying to emulate the paracas? Apparently the skulls also have different nerve structure and less plates then modern human.I see no reason why this could simply be another hominoid- other then of course it flies in the face of ttodays accepted theories.

It is a human rights and civil rights movement. Sexual orientation and gender identity are accidents of birth, just like skin colour, and ethnic origin. Those are things you don't decide upon; they are not a belief or choice. The so-called main stream definitions are wrong. We clung on to them for so long because simplicity is attractive, especially when it is binary. But no matter how much easier to believe the simpler definitions may be, that doesn't make them true. And forcing real people to fit those definitions is barbaric. Gays having to pretend to be straight out of fear of being discriminated or killed ... that's not a life. The same is true for trans people: gender identity sometimes doesn't align with assigned sex at birth. But condemning them to a life of self-denial, or having them beaten, killed, and driven to suicide, just so that simplicity of definition may reign over reality ... is a crime against humanity.",Talks at Google,en,0.9624497294425964

But I feel that having more bias in the news would add to the confusion and lack of orientation that we experience already. I think news should be told in the words of those involved, or in photography/ film. Then, the biases are of those involved in the situations, the information can be contextualised better, and there'll be at least some extent of representation.Aljazeera's 'Witness' and VICE documentaries are quite good in this respect, although not perfect of course. But they instil curiosity and a sense of importance about the subject matter. Point is, I think social media will help the voices of those involved in events be heard better, to enable us to understand the reality, rather than the intrigues and technicalities that take up air time. Palestine is a key example. A lot more people have become attuned to the reality of the apartheid there because more voices from those involved are coming through in social media. But of course, these voices can be flooded with mindless droll. I need to go to bed. ",Talks at Google,en,0.98441743850708

Current levels at 385 ppm are close to the lowest in the history of this planet. below 200ppm, and we'd all be dead. Below 500, and plants die off dramatically. CO2 is great for life on earth, plants love it, which is why CO2 levels in Greenhouses are 1000ppm. We need more CO2, not less. Most of the people commenting on this video seem to think that CO2 is a poison, when it is a necessity for life on earth. Nor is CO2 a big player when it comes to Greenhouse gases. Water vapour accounts for 95% of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with CO2 accounting for just 3.6%, of which the human contribution is just 0.117%, completely insignificant and unlikely to have any but the barest minimal effect on the climate. Atmospheric levels of CO2 are indeed rising today, but there has been no global warming now for 18 years. You global warming junkies so want the world to warm that you can scream ' CO2 CO2' as loud as you can at every opportunity, but however loud you shout, nature will just do what it has always done, the climate will change, ice ages will come and go, and this will carry on long after humans have disappeared from the face of the earth.",Talks at Google,en,0.963693618774414

Whenever I see the alleged "" no warming for some period"" canard, I know I am dealing with a buffoon or a shill.  There has been a LOT of heating....and cooling....on a year to year basis for the last 18 years.  The idiotic idea that drawing a line between one data point and another somehow determines a trend is just as dumb as you can get.  So, try this.  You are starting your line at 1997-1998, a freakishly hot year, and ends up today.  The line was nearly flat when you guys were drawing it to end at 2013.  But when drawn to today, it shows an increase.  Now try this.  Since 2000 is within your 18 year time frame, draw a line from the average global temperature from 2000 to today.  It is a steeply rising line, because 2000 was an unusually cool year.  So, if you use this idiotic technique that you are proposing, then there has been moderate heating during the last 18 years, or there has been severe heating in the last 16 years.  Neither is valid.  The trend line, smoothing the extremes both high and low, show a moderate heating for decades and continuing into the future.  So Timmy, you are dismissed.

I don't expect many people and especially  sheeple to understand much of the material she presents here but you can get through it with at least a cursory grasp of what she shows you and my only critique is that the charts and graphs didn't stay up longer. I certainly don't understand much of the detailed logistics of how all this stuff works but after a couple years investigating and researching the history of how banks and bankSTERS in particular have crashed OUR economy and are doing the precise same thing to this day with even less oversight than they had before the 2008 crash, I KNOW alot more about how these scumbags operate in manipulation and  covering their asses than I ever thought of or cared to know before. They are up to no good AGAIN and AGAIN, the oversight is minimal at best. Watch and see how it happens AGAIN and sooner than you'd imagine if you're not paying attention. It is said that (and if you think that) ""Ignorance is bliss"" but what I say to that is...wait until you see what happens after that when your ignorance is realized? She gives a comparison of a jet fighter (F-16) and the fact that the guys (gals too now) who sit in the cockpit don't get the chance to do that (in flight anyway) without having thousands of hours in the air FIRST. What she doesn't add is the fact that these A/C have the potential to wreak havoc, death and destruction on any victim of its weapons system(s) and skills of the person flying it. The banks have a similar ability to bring death and destruction to people's lives but without the violence of military wrath and the people at the helms of these banks, i.e. BANKSTERS (until they become human), have the responsibility to fly it correctly and to use its operating, weapons and navigation systems professionally and to ONLY engage a target that isn't ""friendly."" Unless, until and only IF all bank officers think along the lines of professional operations with integrity and ethics and a hard set idea of the ruinous ramifications they will incur for the possibly dramatic injuries they may cause by making unnecessary, uneducated, unconsidered, indifferent, ignorant (there's that word again) or downright callous mistakes whether accidental or otherwise on non-combatants. If you're at the helm of of one of these vessels, you must always be mindful of the fact that the rudder turns both ways...you can fly right or you can fly WRONG and IF you choose the latter, there will be hell to pay for you here on this earth before you go to the Penis Cheney way hotter than hell you deserve where Satan won't be there to help and worshiping you! It is said that money is the root of all evil. I think NOT. It is a tool used toward the root(s) of all evil. I feel that GREED AND POWER are the roots of all evil and when the POWER OF LOVE overcomes the love of power, the world will then have peace which we all deserve.",Talks at Google,en,0.9915441274642944

They do not want to address their 'cash cow' violent system and instead focus on the symptoms of poverty and crime. Maybe Gates is wanting to open private jails so this works well.

Its more important the appearance, giftedness or skill.

The biggest tell is that he's using Newtonian physics to describe a relativistic event. We already know Newtonian physics is an approximation for relativity. It's not accurate at all for events happening on a much larger scale. His hurricane analogy, while accurate in some sense, doesn't really disprove black holes.2. He asserts that all black holes have to rotate. In his argument, all black holes can only exist in spiral galaxies which isn't true either. The rotational force of spiral galaxies isn't necessarily caused by a black hole. All matter have an attractive force between one another. If you ever threw 2 magnets in parallel and close enough together, they'll maintain their forward velocity but start spiraling around one another. In this same way, stars and other matter in space swirl around each other in spiral galaxies.3. You also have to realize this guy literally says he's just taken ""some"" astronomy classes in college. Based on his age, you can surmise the curriculum taught while he was learning probably wasn't the most recent. Even if we gave him the benefit of the doubt and said he just finished the courses, black holes are very complicated physical phenomenons that are studied in depth for years.

But WMAP uses false or irrational assumption like being able to substract the signal of 290.000 galaxies incorporated in one single WMAP-Pixel and claim the rest is CMB-Radiation. This is nonsense and there is no way to argue rationally, that it is possible.Background Radiation means, that the signal was emitted from behind all the galaxies, made it's way through at least 290.000 galaxies and probably 290.000.000.000.000.000 Stars, which all emit microwaves. Further more, the detector for the so called CMB-Radiation didn't leave our solar system, the satellite stayed all the time inside and ""looked"" through the ""fog"" of solar plasma and particles all emitting microwave radiation. The only correct data they got is the signal of the Milky Way galaxy, that's the huge red beam signal in the middle of the picture, which reaches from one side to the other, because it's a 360° picture.http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/map_images/q_5yr_moll_2048.pngLook at the WMAP I posted here, that's the signal which was measured, more or less raw-data. Now we can go forward to interpretation of that picture, every single pixel contains the signal of at least 290.000 galaxies.

Since it was a single particle they would FILL the existing gravity field, the Universe, instantly vibrating at an unimaginable high frequency generating a potential power so high I refuse to state the number I calculate. The size of the universe increases as the particle vibrating area increases and begins decreasing as they acquire mass through fusion with each other. In a few million years a large number of Galaxies form and the process continues to expand the Universe until the gravity of the Galaxies takes over and the Universe returns to the single particle. Then the crushing force of the entire Universe causes the cubic kilometer (guesstimate) containing approximately 2.5 X 10^104 particles per cubic meter to implode and .....REPEAT....This fits the string theory and the complex oscillations, that you like, are derived relying on Time as the ONLY added dimension.

It isn't immediately obvious that a vacuum contains energy until you consider the complex components of the solution to quadratic line integral of the 9-dimensional Fermi equation written as a tensor.Elementary analysis of the equation leads to several interesting real and unreal solutions. When the trivial solutions are excluded and the RMS value of the negative solutions is added to the sum over all i the result is, of course, a natural non-integer.The inescapable conclusion is, therefore, that the origin of dark energy is the interaction at the boundary layer of the universal hadron density and the tachyon vector normalised at the Schwarzkopf limit.A back-of-an-envelope calculation leads to the rough result of 80% which is very close to the observed value.Further calculations should lead to a more accurate value once we can find a larger envelope.",Talks at Google,en,0.9737287759780884

I am a Journeyman Railroad safety inspector who began working for Amazon in California back in 2013. I turned down a ""lead associate"" position as I do not believe in starting out as a boss; one must work upward to earn it. In orientation and at ""stand-up"" meetings they preach Safety, Quality and then Speed, however, the bosses get you alone and say ""forgot what you just heard, Quick, Fast, Speed is the key. Therefore, safety and quality mean nothing to this company. In fact, this company is a Chinese concept operating in the USA. My safety requests were ignored by their maintenance department who supplied us with cheap Chinese step stools in which Amazon removed the wheels, thus making the stool more than 40% weaker. Therefore, people put their feet right through them and they were injured. When I began to be harassed by a company lead, I sent an E-mail to my manager to inform him, which was ignored for weeks. I noticed that my department (ICQA) was creating errors and assigning those errors to other people, I reported this. I was made to completely understand that they use this method as a ""filter"" to wrongfully terminate employees they don't want. On one particular night in the wee hours of the morning Amazon allowed contractors to perform illegal welding ( no dust suction, fans or open windows to ventilate as they were still building this facility while we were working in it) in the building which caused a thick fume of welding vapor and gases to overwhelm the entire workforce (including me) in their A-Mod. People ran out choking, coughing, complaining of a terrible headache and appeared as if ready to vomit. My boss told me to keep working! I went to their Amcare station and pleaded with them to help as this is a very serious Cal-OSHA violation. The company began to retaliate against me, denying any excuse for any absence which is illegal as you cannot punish people for merely being ill. I was very sick with pneumonia for weeks and had to go to the Emergency room at the hospital; my medical proof of my extensive treatments was rejected. I was told, ""too bad you don't qualify for the FLP (family leave program) as I had not been there for a year or more. However, my co-worker hired the same day I was, had been granted permission to the program even though it was not she who was ill, it was her very old mother. She was allowed to miss more than two months worth of work with no penalty, or loss of PTO (paid time off) or UPT (unpaid time off) and she thought it was funny and bragged about it. The General Manager is a carpetbagger from England and cares nothing for the USA. I kept a time, dated employment journal (as always) which I E-mailed to their management and informed as to my issues. I also demanded to speak with the GM who would only speak with me at around three AM. I was denied a witness and I was informed that he would ""take care of it"" and I was fired the next day.Amazon deleted all of my time cards, so I could not prove that they did not pay me for the last three days I worked. I was led to a dark room by one person from human resources and someone I had never before met; they only spoke in barely audible whispers (out of fear that I was recording them) I was handed a credit card (for final payment which was not accurate) with no breakdown of my payment. I was the highest performer in my department (ICQA) achieving a perfect score several times and I had no negative performance reviews which totaled more than twenty; Amazon erased them all and placed two negative reviews (devoid of my signature) in their place. Finally, I demanded to view and record my employee file to which they refused (this is illegal as anyone has a right to view their file) and told me it would have to be subpoenaed. I was not acting as a whistle-blower, or I would have informed to OSHA, but I did not; I tried to help this bald-headed traitor to the American concept.

But it is interesting to notice how the entire concept of strategy seems to be based on the notion of win-lose-games. As in games where you have an opponent ( or even ""enemy"" to use the warlanguage ) and where the purpose is assumed to ""beat"" this opponent. As he mentioned in warfare in MOST cases the battles are very prolonged and in fact both parties lose. Meaning : The win-lose narrative does not seem to actually work in practice. Because of this it is strange that not more was said about the strategy for win-win games. Here of course you avoid the entire problem of someone trying to frustrate you and prevent your strategy from working. In win-win games there is even an incentive for transparent cooperation and mutual learning which is not possible in a win-lose scenario. Is win-win strategy a neglected and overlooked area in this research?",Talks at Google,en,0.9891173243522644

An Oxford don speaks to a naive, cocooned Silicon Valley audience. He's got lots of knowledge, but offers limited advice. He's old school, from an old country, wearing a navy suit and tie.  Google employees who introduce and question Freedman wear t-shirts. They don't appear to have read his book, but remain cocky.Freedman has a message. It's best expressed by his Eisenhower quote. ""Plans are worthless, but planning is essential."" Strategic plans rarely pan out as expected. People love narratives, and those who succeed cast their success as a series of strategic steps. Most often close examination finds these steps were solutions to immanent problems, not stages of a strategy driven journey.This doesn't sit well with Google's analytic programmers. Check the source code of this page, and there's certainly a link that reports my behavior to them. They package and sell this data to advertisers, claiming it predicts market behavior. Being lectured on the limits of repeated ""games,"" on unpredictable randomness, tells them Google's users may not respond as they're expected.Freedman studies war and business, but his advice is mostly for business people, not warriors.

Technology depends on it. Charlatans depend on misleading people. That requires the illusion of truth.In everyday life the worth of truth is measured by the capacity of deception and ignorance to cause harm. e.g. ""Climate change doesn't matter because God will look after it"" is the stated belief of some congressmen. All religions have notions of teleology at their core.

The most knowledgable engineer on the planet is still ultimately dictated to by the artist and A&R, because they are the engineer's clients. This has created the bizarre situation where 'the customer knows best' even when the customer ends up wrecking the end result for their customers; the listeners and fans.It must be uniquely frustrating as an engineer to submit a mix to a band, knowing that their response can be translated as, ""we'd like you to ruin it, or we'll ruin you.""

Rick Rubin has been championing hot mixes for years, but there's also that bootlegged early mix of Californication (possibly a pre-release candidate) that is mixed a lot less hot. Presumably Rubin was involved in the creation of that, too. I think the album was mixed sensibly at first, then mixed and mastered hot, and Rubin prefers to take the credit for that rather than look like he was shouted down. Unfortunately, Californication went on to be RHCP's biggest seller, and more artists and A&R people start demanding similar.I think these guys have been backed into a corner (partly of their own making). Now, no one wants their mix thrown back at them by the artist saying ""what are we, a jazz combo?"" so they mix hot, because that's what the client wants from them.

Liberals and liberal academia cannot face, nor acknowledge, that the true reason for these failings lie in decades of Democrat liberal policies. They can’t acknowledge that government dependency, welfare, food stamps, and a host of other government programs that were supposed to help the black community, actually proved to have the opposite effect. They can’t acknowledge this because they were the architect of these policies. While Libertard College Professors everywhere in the USA view themselves as Harbingers of Neo-Justice"" (and take their ideals a bit too far) they are actually feeding the fires of black on black street crime and anti-Americanisms in the Black communities. In the end labeling all whites in America as ""Privileged"" will do more harm than good. Hard working whites who struggled to get where their at just can't accept the theory that they got what they have via some crazy pre arranged plan to lift them up, and to keep  non-whites down. According to the proponents of White Privilege we have an elderly lady named Peggy McIntosh to blame for this radical theory. It's believed she came up with , and coined the phrase ""White Privilege"" In her narratives she recounts stories of herself throughout her life as being one of privilege she never asked for. Her successes in life were the result of white privilege, not work ethics. She fully blames others (White America) for setting it in motion and she was just born into it as we all were thus dismissing any real, still living culprits. She's rather intelligent and soft spoken and seems believable to most people. She makes a fine first impression. But if you read between the lines it's not difficult to see her true self. A depressed and somewhat self-defeated middle aged lonely woman who's life never really amounted to anything, and suffers heavily from perceived white guilt. But, in reality she's just the counter person for a more sinister kitchen filled with extreme radical left-tist cooks. These people are better described as the ""Neo Communist- Zionist-5th Column"" who have a hold on America's Schools and Congress. Their plan is one of divide and conquer and they're doing a fine job of it by driving a huge wedge down the already on life support heart of the American Racial divide.",Talks at Google,en,0.9146539568901062

No matter how much these people  help the blacks, the blacks will put them down as Jews.  If not now, then later.This is a form of institutional politically correct racism. In the inner city, if I profile, I am called a racist.  If I don't profile,  I am called a naive white dude.Bernie Sanders, black lies do matter.Black lives do matter.  This is why I appreciate Larry Elders for inspiring fellow blacks to not depend on welfare.   There is a place for welfare,  and Larry has gone too far with the Libertarian thing. But since 1965, welfare has been a two sided coin.  It helped perpetuate replacing the black daddy with the government welfare daddy.  Possibly without welfare, greater pressure would be placed on the black father to stay and provide to the nest.  And with the esteem of being truly needed and valued, the father then protects his sons from joining a gang.One sided KCET does not help the blacks.  Obama does not help the blacks.  His 'evolving' thoughts on gay marriage while collecting money from liberal Studio City and Malibu hurts the black family further.  Now, the tradiditional balanced perspectives of a real mom and dad in the black home is further diminished. Even if the members are not gay, people now see less of the combined  unique value of a real father and mother.So, KCET, put the concept of institutional racism to the side, and help the black father achieve self worth  in his own home.Manufacturing jobs leaving the country did not help the black father.

I know for a fact I have sexual needs and I also know I do NOT have needs for commitment or a family or any of that garbage, that just sounds like work, the only reason monogamy is appealing to me is because trying to hook up with a new guy every week or so is a lot of work and a lot of work I don't feel like doing any more. Sex is usually the only way I can potentially be romantically interested in a guy and 9 times out of 10 I develop 0 romantic feelings for him. I've hooked up with hundreds (not exaggerating, 2-3 guys every week for 4 years continuously and I'm probably giving a conservative number) of guys and the guys and I've only fallen for 4 of those guys. The only reason I did this was because I had sexual needs, I was told I didn't and I shouldn't have these desires but I did and I couldn't help but act on them. Do you know how much bullshit I went through just for sex? Sex was more important to my mental health to me than just about anything else. Without sex I don't think I'd have motivation for anything really. Sex drives me to live, it's the reason I get up everyday if I had to narrow it down, it's sex, that's why I get up, that's what I live and breathe, that's me very existence because it makes me happy, it makes me feel good, it helps me fall asleep, it allows me to lose stress,  it acts as a pain reliever and many more beneficial things.",Talks at Google,en,0.9843854308128356

I told everyone I was a Rogue.Such intense moments trying to keep my cover.  Skulking about acting like I'm looking for Traps, when I wouldn't know a Trap even after it killed me.  My first Locked Picked for Treasure (it wasn't locked, but no one knew it... myself included).The only distraction was a Meta-Gamer who kept worrying about my Character instead of his ""Hey, you're a Rogue... shouldn't you be doing this?  Hey, do this.  Do that.  Let me see your Character Sheet.""  That was the only thing that came close to ruining the awesomeness of the adventure.I worked harder crafting his Back Story and getting his details (Handem Swyndel) than I had on anyone ever before, poured my soul into that attempt.So I can always thank 2nd Edition for how things were Restricted, and how that became my Challenge.LOL!  ""You see a Chest.  It looks locked.""  Hey guys, we need to be safe... I need you guys checking the other corners of this room for Traps, Secret Doors, things like that.  Don't worry, I'll be coming around and checking what you find.""  Hmm, did they buy that?  While they aren't looking, what's the incantation for 'Knock' again?  Gotta be quiet, can't let them see me gesture. Loved it.But from a Rules and Lay Out point, 3.5 was all me.  But then they went HEAVY into Forgotten Realms, and THAT is right up my alley.I'll have to look into 5 again, but it just seems so much like Warhammer RPG.",Talks at Google,en,0.9934315085411072

It is very wrong I think in this day and age as 2015 compared to the last 10 - 20 - 50 years or so that we have reached a point that cannabis users in many western countries can be treated with the following punishments/behavior:1. Denied potential drivers license even if not associated with driving during drug screening.2. Have potential careers wrecked and lives ruined. Not because Weed or so got the best of someone, but because, police, fines, prosecution, jail, courts, and social punishment.I could go on... but here is what I am wondering... I mean... To shun people in society... neighbors, family, friends, co workers, countrymen... People who often and even very likely have a job, perhaps even education, contribute to society, and maybe even have no criminal motive or pleasure to ""break the law"" or do anything to hurt the society... Why criminalize people and mistreat badly for perhaps only smoking some weed or hasj and just kicking back a rare occasion. When if we actually are worried for someone, there must be better ways to make the good people of society remain good law abiding citizens and not criminalize the population based on non violent non threatening crimes.A good leader and a good person would never turn on his or her own.This drug thing is something we need to handle together...At least stop hurting people who deem little or no threat to society...Most people are good people...Sorry for ramble...I have no potato..",Talks at Google,en,0.947870135307312

The Pharmaceutical Companies and the whole medical system is evil -     Not the Doctors just the system,  the doctors are just victims who have been highjacked into   believing  that the only health care is toxic petro chemical synthetic drugs.  Unfotunately what is happening is that the enlightened Doctors are being hunted down, sued, and struck from the Medical Register for ""malpractice"".      ""Malpractice"" means they practice a medicine which subtracts from the  $trillion drug industry and actually heals the patient.    The corrupt medical systems needs to keep the patient sick. What I would like to add is that I could be of assistance to Dr. Rankikn,   Her question as to why patients who eat well, exercise, meditate, and ask themselves what they need to get better still have Stage IV Cancer.          Often the real root cause of people's symptoms are ocult.   Meaning they are not aware.    Painful emotional trauma, which they do not remember, even with years of psychotherapy are often the cause of cancer or degenerative disease.    Deadly poisons in foods such as dried fish (mercury) - case of family suffering from systemic multifacet symptoms.      cheap   sub-standard chocolates (again mercury residues) case of 10 year old child in Bali suffering from symptoms of Ebola, heamoragic fever, severe headache,     .   Sundried tomatoes  casing blindness (not yet tested or researched at FAO documentation).    All these are real life cases which have recovered spontaneously once the ocult poisoning was discovered.       How did I discover the real root cause?  All information, every thought, every word, movement of every being in the universe is registered in an invisible magnetic tape.   This magnetic tape is everywhere at the same time.       WE are everywhere at the same time  at subatomic, Quantum level.  If Dr.Rankin would like to contact me I  would like to contribute to Dr. Rankins's work to enrich what she is already contributing to humanity.   We can discover the real reason  her friend with Stage IV Cancer ha not recovered completely and find the real cause of her imbalance.      I can test remotely using a surrogate.    By the way, I have been practicing holistic medicine since 1983 and have developed my own method of Quantum Kinesiology resulting from my years of study.

Yeah really sounds like a great plan for teaching divine revelation to an infant who can't even articulate thought into language yet. There is absolutely no evidence for anything you are suggesting. The major problem with new age pseudo-spirituality along with nearly every other form of mysticism is that it completely ignores basic logic and rationale. The only way you can attempt to back up your claim that there is some sort of metaphysical presence that intentionally designed the universe is to invoke this idea of consciousness existing independently of the body and having an innate spiritual purpose. None of that is parsimonious in the slightest. Life took around 4 billion years to evolve from prokaryotic life into anatomically modern humans. Life was not created by some cosmic author planning out specific events for the creatures that have evolved on our planet. Language, abstract thought, and philosophical speculation are all products of natural evolution. Simply because there has been a concept of a soul stretching back to pre-socratic greek philosophers does not at all validate this idea that the soul even exists or rather it was designed specifically for the learning of lessons.This ""soul"" did not have any sort of consciousness before embodiment. The brain had to develop and form synaptic plasticity between neurons in order to send the nerve impulses to your vocal chords to allow you to say the word ""soul"". This magical soul has absolutely no basis in reality. Let's even suppose that a soul does exist. Let's suppose we are here to learn ""difficult"" lessons. Isn't that quite sick to subject someone to a life of mortality. Subjecting an innocent ""soul"" to a life of poverty in Uganda. Subjected innocent Syrian children to the throes of war. All just to learn that life is precious. PFT.Yeah sure someone suffering from cancer may look back on their life and appreciate living more..... Thats probably because their fucking DYING and trying to cling on to hope or trying to find justification for the pain they are going through. This is not at all the case I would say for the majority of cancer patients. I seriously doubt all the terminally ill sitting bedridden in pain right now are just smiling thinking to themselves ""Oh cosmic designer... I'm so happy you were able to make me endure a life threatening illness so I could really appreciate how precious life is"" ITS FUCKING STUPID. Why did this designer not just design us to already appreciate life? If you have the ability to create humans you sure as hell could have the ability to make them not commit heinous crimes like rape, torture, murder, etc. It makes absolutely no sense. There is also no evidence whatsoever that consciousness floats into the magical ethers when you die and you successfully have learnt these lessons that are oh so important for this supernatural realm your soul would now exist in. It's absurd. And yes disgusting to propose that people deserve pain. The only reason people suffer from mortality and all the pain that goes with it is because THERE WAS NO DESIGNER. We evolved naturally in this phenomenon we call the universe. Nature is impartial. It is not some conscious designer that planned our life. We have completely sequenced the human genome. We understand how life evolved through natural selection. There was no god. There is no fucking purpose. Get over it",Talks at Google,en,0.9676663875579834

For instance staying postive in the face of grim situations. There are plenty of ""souls"" out there who do live a life of charity, love and care. And they still get sick and ill. We are biological organisms, and as such we get sick. Most of us thankfully just slight, and many bad and a few worse. Now i know that a positive mindset helps alot to prevent depression from setting in, or anxieties and such which do affect blood pressure and stress. But some people have a disorder from birth which prevents them from positive thinking, because they suffer and have no recollection of any other state of mind.I have to agree with Sean that the comment really is ignorant - ""maybe our souls choose to experience this disease to learn lessons""  By the same token, one could argue that a person who just hanged him/herself did it because the soul was curious about the experience. If that had ever been put forth as an argument, everyone would agree that the person would be a stupid unfeeling bastard. But in the case of a cancer patient, then it is okay all of the sudden. Because there is still hope that it might regress. I see religious people argue like this all the time, and their perspective is that deceases are punishment from the lord for our sins. If a person recouperates then it is a miracle, and if they don't it is simply not commented upon. Some of these people, like the lady in the video no doubt tries out psychadelics and other mind-altering drugs, and then sit around and philosophies about their experience. The discussion of a higher state of mind, souls and a far reaching conciousness is all fine with me to think about and discuss, since it is a part of existensialism. Something which we all must tackle and think about in some way or another. I just get a little worried when people like these bring it up in serious settings like deceases and treatment. Some people lazily settles for being ""saved"" by following instructions laid out in bronze age parchments. And other people seem to think that we are potential X-men - if we just delved deep enough into our minds. We are like the animals on this planet, the only difference is that we deviate from them by our abilities of communication with ourselves and others. We just construct meanings in our lives which are every bit as peculiar as our individual uniqueness. But they are all just suppositions in lack of knowledge. I tend to think that nature holds the best medicinal potential. Unfortunately the knowledge is dying out with every indigenous tribe.",Talks at Google,en,0.9112985730171204

(if the feel-good hormones were the only component) and there is zero proof of the relationship between chemicals and the Placebo Effect, by the way.

Personally I find throwing more and more drugs and money at chronic illness when the burden of disease continues to rise fairly delusional. Our society is getting sicker and mainstream medicine needs to stop flogging their dead horse and try a different approach. I am not that it should be the one highlighted in this video but to make advances you need to think outside the box and have an open mind. I am not saying that people shouldn't be skeptical. I think it's important to question everything, whatever the information source, I just don't see the benefit in being rude or scathing towards other people for having a different opinion and I really don't see a major difference in the two above situations.

Truth is a pathless land ( J Krishnamurti).  The 70's free spirits did go to the right spiritual place to seek wisdom, but they also consolidated the fatal error of this beautiful nation, the caste philosophy.  It gives out a feeling of confusion, rigidity, disingenuous and superiority, all opposites of what the speaker is trying to convey.  If you are born in 1 culture and tries to garb and talk in another, those feelings are inevitable and conveyed.  Quote my Indian coworker when I asked her why she never liked to join us to the favorite Indian restaurant "" it makes me puke whenever I saw those Lily-white waitresses dressed in elaborate sari"".  For the first few minutes of the talk, he already mentioned Indian, Chinese, Jews, etc, that's divisions inside him and expressed in the most superficial consciousness already.

The physical laws aren't conscious intelligent agents that care about you. You still have to take care of yourself even when you know the physical laws are controlling you. You don't have access to all the physical mechanics happening within and around you, so knowing you're being controlled by those mechanics should mean nothing to your decision making.It's an enormous fallacy to think that being controlled by physical laws means that you should give in to primal desires and emotions and disregard all responsibilities and consequences. As I have stated, nothing changes when you know you are controlled by physical laws because you lack knowledge of those processes and what they will bring. You have no choice but to continue on the presumption of free will even though it may not exist in an absolute sense.

Ranald McKenzie to the previously unknown entrance comprising Palo Duro Canyon, and who in 1871 did then and there accomplish what by modern standards of ""global justice"" should have justifiably occurred to the Comanche no later than their arrival in 1700.Sure, why not blame the choices of the Comanches upon those sneaky europeans who for the most part, refused to accept the same raping, murder of families and subsequent kidnapping of children (Cynthia Ann Parker*) , which prior to then, had been practiced by the noble Comanche upon all other tribes of Indians - a practice which was then stupidly perpetrated upon the white man, but not without consequences. (*Upon murdering her family and kidnapping her at the age of nine, her psychological destruction was accomplished through slavery, sexual and emotional blackmail, and which though still practiced to this day upon sexual slaves worldwide, your 'modernized version' defends this savagery as somehow permissible).Arising from years as working cowboy residing among numerous indian tribes ranging from the Pacific northwest to Texas, those tribes--much alike my grandparents--made clear how, to them as well, the Comanche lifestyle was one of shame -not glory.  For the above reasons your video and its ""myths"" have no place in truth, nor have your actions served the just memory of any peaceful soul who was murdered by and through the Comanche regime.GET OVER YOUR IMAGINATIONS OF ANY NOBLE RACE, -BLACK, WHITE OR RED - AND TRY TEACHING THE FACTS OF IMPERFECT SOCIETY, AS OPPOSED TO THE SAVAGERY OF NO SOCIETY AT ALL.Jim",Talks at Google,en,0.9321871995925904

We are in this mess today because all parties involved in the making of war have given moral and ethical responsibility to someone else. Where the military commits a war crime it is the fault of the politicians who sent them, and where the elected leaders take a nation to war unjustly and without regard for our well being or prosperity they pass the buck to hindsight, fog and friction of war, and just plain old ignorance.

Zahn You're skimming over the argument without considering the logical necessity it proposes. First, notice premise 3 ""A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.""  The quality (or category) of ""greatest possible being"" requires the existence of said being. Since we could imagine something greater than an idea that only exists in the mind, whenever we speak of God as an idea in the mind we are not really speaking about God, because, ""the greatest possible being"" is definitively extant. So, we cannot imagine something great than God who, thus, exists by necessity.   This argument is a bit puzzling at first but has considerable strength.",Talks at Google,en,0.965828537940979

It just seems like that. I have spent hours perplexed by it now. so yo can conceive of god, but by definition, when you conceive of god, you can't think he just exists in the mind. therefore, god must exist in reality because you must admit that god exists conceptually and you must admit that god is the highest possible being. If you are truly stubborn, and admit the obvious (god exists in the mind, e.g. this argument) but declare its in mind alone, you can then imagine a being greater than god (one thats not just in the mind). That being is more so god than the definition you used before that declaration so ipso facto what you think of is not God when you claim God is mental alone. Because you can think of a God as real, but you can't think of a God as solely imaginary, you must consider realness a neccessary attribute of God.  This unintuitive jump comes from formal logic, I think. There is a principle called the law of excluded middle which demands that the logician keep A and Not-A non-equal. God cannot both be in the mind defined as the greatest being and be unreal. God can just not exist in the mind, or it can exist in the mind and in reality at the same time, but any idea of God that is just mental is an impostor concept. Therefore, by the time a ""fool"" claims God is solely in the mind and agrees with Anslems definition of God, he has claimed God is real by considering God at all. If he rescinds his statement God is unreal, and any statement about God at all, there is no logical argument, or logical proof why God is real. I think its more clear to say ""Anslem proved one cannot logically deny the existence of God. One can only stay agnostic or illogically deny God's existence.""I wish I wouldn't have found this problem to be honest. I think its going to confuse me for a long time. It does seem to be a formal logic argument (as opposed to empirical, which would make claims of God seem more overtly right or wrong than this backwards, mind-bending, intellectual puzzle). Hopefully, If I ever go to learn e.g. Modal Logic, I will have a better understanding of this strange argument.",Talks at Google,en,0.9723429679870604

First, neural networks have come a long way since he gave this talk. Now, LSTM networks/neural Turing machines are the major brains behind NLP. Google Translate, for example, is a series of networks that can each translate a human language into a series of vectors representing meaning, share them across a neural interface, and then translate back into a human language. Second, dinosaurs didn't go extinct: tens of thousands of them fly around to this day. Birds and mammals survived the K-T event because they were adaptable. If you look at corvids, they have language skills that far exceed that of all non-human apes; they have more advanced skills in making and using tools than most apes; and they are able to teach others in their flocks about things, perpetuating knowledge through multiple generations. Corvids have a very different brain structure without a neocortex, but their evolutionary history converged upon the same abilities. It is unfortunate that he dismissed both neural networks and non-neocortical brain structures, but he will probably change his opinions.",Talks at Google,en,0.9555180072784424

This approach does not speed up sequential program so there is need to change paradigm for parallel programming. There are two ways: 1) multicore cpu's (2,4,6,8...) cores which support heavy threads (branching prediction etc) or 2) manycore GPU's (thousands of cores) supporting lightweight-threads (single instruction multiple data). Numerical application with high computational complexity are now mainly implemented on GPU's due to high efficiency and low cost <1000USD. 2.

Please do not misunderstand me, I am not saying that Lang Lang is a lousy pianist. I am saying that he has a personal way to play, and I think that is the only way you will ever succeed in today's world of musical performance. After all, Arthur Rubinstein said this in a public interview, when being asked if he was the best pianist of his time:—No, I am not. There are many other pianists who play technically better than I do, but the public likes my way to play, and this is what counts for me.I think the same is true today for Lang Lang. Yuja Wang plays much better than him, and yet he has established a place in a niche of the classical musical repertoire. I am not a fan of his play, but I love him as a human, the way he talks, the way he teaches children, the way he is simply himself.

You should also note that many of those 100,000 were already sick and would have died without any medical intervention as well.* I do not have an exact figure on it, because the alternative ""medicine"" quacks do not allow themselves to be studied.

Wind turbines are visible far and wide, and many people are stuck living among them (animals suffer untold harm). The wind zealots pretend the only land affected is where the towers touch down, which bizarrely ignores the vertical blight and total acreage webbed by towers and roads. A single wind project can loom over tens of thousands of acres, giving the whole area an industrial feel.

The reason is summarized in two words: doubling time (or Td). This is the time it would take for a TMSR to breed enough U-233 to fuel another identical TMSR. And the answer is, in the best of cases, 52 years (in the worst case, 200 years). Remember, first, that U-233 does not exist in nature, it must be created in a breeder reactor in the first place, by breeding thorium, then processing the spent thorium to separate and remove the U-233. Second, because thorium is not fissile although it is fertile, a TMSR requires a certain quantity of U-233 to get a critical reaction started. Check here for the math: https://indico.cern.ch/event/222140/session/7/contribution/27/attachments/363090/505441/Daniel_Mathers_v2_ThEC13.pdf (that's from CERN so I assume these guys know what they are talking about).Conveniently the guys from the Thorium Alliance always forget to mention the issue of doubling time in ALL their interviews, presentations and videos...The US is the only country in the world that has any significant reserves of U-233 (the result of breeding thorium in traditional uranium-cycle reactors) and even so, these reserves would only be enough to get at most a couple of medium-sized (<500MW) reactors started in the first place. Clearly not a solution for the energy/global warming crisis and the simple reason why no country in the world has ever undertaken further work on thorium reactors in the last 50 years (beyond some simple experiments).",Talks at Google,en,0.9436768889427184

He doesn't seem to understand the technology that Google is developing or what it really means to ""call up information instantly"". While the smartphone and other wearables exist, the latency and the external presence of the information are just a surrogate memory and inferior to the real thing, but as the technology continues to get smaller, you'll get to the point where it's actually IN the brain. At that point it can interact with the brain's circuitry and all the world's information can not only be instantly called at any time, but it becomes a meaningful statement to say that it's part of your memory. At that point, memorising something will literally be no different to posting a piece of information onto the internet, which, given that level of sophistication, you could do via thought.",Talks at Google,en,0.9909568428993224

But what would certainly appear to be true is that, whether or not the individual associates 'insights'  into life with a particular activity or so-called 'technique' - the insights, if they happen and are genuine, are insights by the mind (what else?). The techniques are largely irrelevant.The rise of the 'Scientific Method' and the technology which is testament to the rectitude of said method, has uncovered many of the truths of existence. And there's plenty more to come.The fact that some think that it hasn't uncovered truths about the 'inner world' (and Freud, to name but one anyway gives the lie to that) is perhaps due to a misconception about what constitutes the 'inner' and the 'outer'.What is EXTREMELY alarming is the hold that 'Spiritual woo-woo' still has on the human mind, whereby otherwise intelligent persons will unquestioningly believe the analysis/statements etc. of such characters as Tolle, on the basis that he claims and/or is supposed to have 'infallible' knowledge'And this despite the fact that it doesn't take Albert Einstein to see immediately that many, if not most of them are incorrect and/or blatantly contradictory.Science is neither 'good' nor 'bad. It's neutral. It is human beings that are PHENOMENALLY dangerous. They simply don't seem to be able to chew gum and walk in a straight line. And it's getting worse as they get more desperate.

I don't know Brian Tracy, but what I have lived after being touched by Eckhart's teachings is this: you can have plans, you can set your goals and objectives, but you always have to go back to the Now. For an example: It's 6:30 PM and I just got home after work. I set up this time, in my schedule, to plan on the postgraduate course I wanna do. I'm at the stage of researching for one, so I go to the internet and check some universities's websites to see courses... by 7 PM I have to start doing dinner. It's 7 PM now and I haven't finished doing all the research I wanted, so I set up another time to do it, tomorrow. And now, as it is 7 PM, I go to the kitchen and start doing dinner: I take the vegetables from the refrigerator to prepare a salad, and as I do that, I'm REALLY doing that: I'm paying full attention at opening the fridge, looking for the vegetables, taking them, feeling their texture... in all these little actions, my attention is on what I'm doing NOW. I'm not thinking (while I do these things) ""oh, tomorrow I'm looking at this or that university... but maybe it's too expansive... but I guess will be a good course..."" I'm not thinking at all. I'm just there, doing dinner, maybe I can say I'm doing dinner and fully observing I'm doing dinner. This is being in the Now, and you can apply it to any situation in your life.So when it's time to plan, you plan. When it's time to sleep, you sleep. You do at the time whatever you have to do in the time, and that time is always Now.No matter what you set up as goal, every goal is made of smaller steps... As, in the example, to do a postgraduate course you must research where to do, compare different universities, then compare financial investments, see how to finance that, then decide for the course, then apply... etc. The key is to focus in every step as they happen, when they happen in the Now.I don't know if this helps you, hope it can =)",Talks at Google,en,0.9802187085151672

Every cycle follows a similar pattern. It begins when growth picks up and companies invest in new capacity to meet perceived future needs. Production costs tend to escalate at this stage, as do asset prices, especially for equities and property, driven up in part by speculators. Inexpensive credit encourages businesses to commit to large, capital-intensive factories and offices. At this critical point, demand and current output both begin to slow, even as consumption continues to accelerate. A lack of savings spurs an increase in personal and commercial borrowing. To satisfy domestic demand, companies start to import more and export less, a trend that soon results in a balance-of-payments deficit. The economy is now officially out of kilter, freighted by over-investing, over-consumption, over-borrowing, and over-lending. Here beings the slide into recession. Prices are pushed higher by the use of less efficient means of production, by the growth in the money supply and by speculation. Tighter and much more expensive credit raises the cost of outstanding debt. Asset values, inflating in the upswing, are punctured. Borrowers can no longer make their payments, and the collateral available for new loans is restricted. Incomes, investment and consumption all fall off. Companies and entrepreneurs flounder or go bankrupt; unemployment rates rise. As confidence evaporates, borrowing and spending dry up. Long-term capital investments made in better days now come on line, increasing supply and depressing prices just as demand is slackening. Companies and individuals are forced to sell off assets at a loss, deepening the crisis, but many potential buyers wait for the market to hit bottom before purchasing, further delaying recovery. Me and you can guess what the next bubble will burst. Last time it was the housing bubble next will either be the student loan bubble or the healthcare cost bubble. Too many cycles of inconsistency and fragility like this will demand people and governments to make a paradigm shift on a new economic system away from the preceding one. Hence, post-capitalism...which is not a planned movement per se but more a gradual, natural move toward fundamental market principles of collective arrangement of labor, cohesive economic practices limiting turbulence, utilizing and expounding on abundant resources for all sectors of the economy, etc.",Talks at Google,en,0.9722498655319214

Much like all art really. If the creator has made it very definitive your subjective opinion is not a quality of that artwork, it is projection of your views on the artwork. When creator tells straight ""I have a clear idea what was real and what was not"" - one going ""but the film is so open so I get to make interpretations anyway right?"" only within the limits of the author's words. It is very pompous to say you are higher than the creator when telling a meaning of art. That is not to say, many things said ring true, but there is also very pompous attitude dismissing the CREATOR HIMSELF. If anything he says contradicts you, you might want to go and seek other explanations. According to this video's ""quote"" what he said was open anyway, though I am sure he meant that certain parts are real.Other explanation would be, that there is reality, but it is made for viewer to question the ""reality"" of that world, and realizing it is not real at all.Maybe it is actually meta of Nolan's dream, shared with all the viewers. That would mean in the film's world, the first layer is real to the film, but unreal, because it ultimately is, which is the one nice point made in this talk.Overall it is a good talk, and raises good questions. But what I personally dislike, is for the consumer of art to be pompous enough to trample on any intentions the creator had, if he had set in stone, in his own words certain things about his work that he says are as they are.In video games, Silent Hill is one series trampled by many, many fan interpretations of things that happen during the plot of four first games. After this, the original team was disbanded completely and moved on to other projects, but because of franchise recognition, konami hired numerous, smaller teams to make more games for the series, which projected some fan interpretations, and even interpretations of the movie maker Gantz who made the movie adaptions, which also were filled with subjective, but ultimately false interpretations of the first game. This franchise now consists of far more works that are worse than the core beginning of three games since the fan interpretations under false pretense of ""it is all vague anyway so I get to say what I think is the fact"", until the point it was projected by the new makers who frankly had only fan interpretations to work with, since they did not want to invest time to take the games as they are, and work with that.",Talks at Google,en,0.9817739129066468

Create enough lies and you'll never know what is true or not. There is a fine line between limbo and reality.The matrix never told us about life being a dream? It simply told us that we are subjected to our system, literally slaves, blinded by the illusions that system holds us to. And that only few of us can be unplugged (or as Plato would say: break free of the cave and see the eye-blinding light of the sun). And the more we are adjusted to this system, the more difficult it becomes to see truth in it all.

We don't need the just power to analyze information that is in front of us.   We need to power to build ideas when and where they are least expected.  Yes some of this building requires analysis, but first there are components of thought that allow us to make novel connections between the sea of distant elements.  The cult of the analytic (including Kahneman, have created a society where creativity has fallen behind.  Here is a quote regarding JOhn Von Neumann, ""Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 mph. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the infinite series so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: ""Oh, you must have heard the trick before!"" ""What trick?"" asked von Neumann, ""All I did was sum the geometric series.""      It's clear then that certain solutions are best developed with less conscious deliberation, rather the ability to automatically attract distant ideas into some novel permutation, and then upon a slight moment of reflection, realize there is something useful there.   As Einstein said, ""The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant we have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift"".",Talks at Google,en,0.9152889847755432

But the system we live in, especially academia, completely ignores System 1 thinking, while System 2 takes the spotlight with standards tests and formal protocols.  Of course, the predictability of these protocols are limited.  Until we design theories of mind, that account for differences in real-time cognitive processing.

Intuition in large systems allows for arbitrary pieces of that system to be arrange into new models, which are then further analyzed for information.  The usual reason why most people are opposed to IQ tests, whether they know why or not, is because conventional reasoning theory suggests that reasoning involves merely analyzing sets, for example,  2, 8, 10, 40, however, these theories disregard the fact that novel sets can be constructed by the individual, for example, I can put together a sequence such as Box, Paper, Line, period,  and have an abstract idea in mind - but it is one that I completely created, even if my influence of selection, did involve similarities or factual information, the specific selection and arrangement of these items contains novelty, which IQ tests are blind to.  In very complex systems , like math or physics, the brain requires to pull ideas that are very distant and arrange them new ways - even when creating proofs and conjectures.   The pre-analytical processes, reflect essentially, the experimental capacity of the mind.  The great thought experiments of history are based on empirical connection of ideas; Galelios free fall, the Fizeau experiment, Einsteins relativity (Einstein a big believer of intuition). There is around 1000 years of philosophy that is dedicated to the power of observation and experimental thought (several hundred dedicated to a priori), yet reasoning theory has nothing to say about this.",Talks at Google,en,0.990703582763672

System 1 role in complexity, is that it allows one to select/create a novel arrangement of information,  when dealing with complex empirical systems (math/physics/chemistry/ect).  In this sense, System 1 deals with meta-compexity.  However, after information has been drawn together, system 2 takes over and can deal with micro-complexity.",Talks at Google,en,0.9874736070632936

System 1, type thinking is involved in parallel processing, selecting and creating sets/models (bringing ideas together).   System 2 , is involved in analyzing these models. Most Western philosophers of mind have praised intuition; Einstein and Poincare., but the contemporary Western Psychology is biased against it. We are not the author of intuitive thinking?! What crap!  Intuitive thinking is what allows us to relate distant ideas.  How does conehman think he chose the random numbers and operator, 24 * 17. He selected and ordered the elements, and created a relationship.  System 2 thinking has been long over-rated.",Talks at Google,en,0.9879111051559448

Though there really aren't 2 systems, but 2 components.   Intuitive thinking fast (usually), but definitely deals with complexity better.  'Intuition' is responsible for ordering and selecting ideas based on structural overlap (associative memory), injecting elements into a problem, creating ordered sets of information, and also responsible for dealing with complex processing and parallel integration of ideas.  Large problems don't fit in 'system 2', because it is limited to 7/ +- 2  bits of information.  Therefore, in contrast to Khaneman (Conman ..lol) complexity is dealt with best by System 1.  System 2 then analyzes results.  Intuition is important, because we never know when or where the insight to a complex problem will show up, so taking our time and trying really hard (System 2) is usually fruitless. We need to rely on evolutionary and adaptive heuristics (see gerd gigerenzer).  It's no wonder why Einstein valued intuition so much.  Yes, and even before Khaneman solved  24 * 17, intuition allowed him to pre-consciously select and order the number and operator.  As intutiion is allowing me to type these words without consciously selecting and ordering each word.   Khaneman is a fraud, and a gullible  and entitle-minded public, support him, because they would rather believe that great ideas are the product of some 'lazy' system 2 process then some underlying heuristic abilities that allow for the production of some novel permutations.P.S   I like your video on IQ test bias.",Talks at Google,en,0.9939655661582948

He's combatted poverty, ignorance, disease, he's rescued people from boats at sea, he's evacuated the wounded from combat zones, resettled refugees, helped hungry children and orphans, opposed war, produced and disseminated peace literature, trained peace and social workers, and rebuilt villages destroyed by bombs. How can you say that this man has never suffered? you may have worked a full time job, raised a family, or have been in a relationship, but have you ever gone hungry? has your home ever been destroyed by nuclear weapons? What he teaches is that when one person suffers, so does the other. He's dedicated his life to alleviating the suffering of others through compassion and loving kindness. While you've been working full time and raising a family, he's taken on the suffering of strangers who have had their families taken away from them by war and disease.

The pace of life and rate of change in a Tibetan monastery leaves a lot of time to devotion to single task in the present moment. We live in a world where planning and anticipating about upcoming events while we are aware of our surroundings and engaged in  completing a task is that does not require full concentration such as cleaning or walking. Mindfulness is a luxury of a life with a slow pace, day to day sameness, and not many responsibilities.

I was much the same a few months back. Two jobs, a kid and a wife and all that comes with it kept me on my toes around the clock. Up until recently I was experiencing almost daily panic attacks. I had SO much I had to think about.I am not one to say you can be mindful every second of every day. But what Thich Nhat Hanh is getting at is for us - the lay people. We need a practical application to our daily lives which is why being mindful for even a minute or two a day is great. It breaks the train wreck of constant thinking, pondering, worrying, etc. And what I have found so far is even a little mindfulness everyday can really go a long way. Thanks for your reply and I hope all goes well.",Talks at Google,en,0.9792670011520386

It reduces stress, improves confidence and so on. I think you misunderstand this practice as taking break, but it's literally just a few seconds of letting your mind rest and getting back with full swing.It is very true that monks in a monestary have a much easier setting to practice these mental exercises than you, but they attempt to actually master them. You on the other hand only need to be a novice at this practice to see it benefit your life.Plus, there are multiple studies that prove that the human brain is incapable of proper multitasking. Multitasking just means doing many things in a bad way, when really our brain is designed to focus on one task at a time. Mindfullness helps a great deal with it.I know what you're thinking, ""I don't have the luxury/time to work like that.""

As such, the types of things discussed in this video are similar to what has been discussed with Kinect, Real Sense, and Leap Motion as well as what has been seen with demos of HoloLens.  It could be that the disconnect is that the video doesn't clearly state that the focus here is in a higher resolution and thus much better tracking down to a more specific finger gesture rather than more of a hand gesture.As a note: I'm not bashing the technology - I'm obviously interested as I watched the video and took the time to comment.

In the hands-on demo for HoloLens, they show a couple of hand gestures for controlling, selecting and such. It will also be interesting to see how Oculus Touch does with gesture recognition as well. Granted, that is a different approach since it requires holding a device. Overall, the tech is getting better and it seems what is falling behind is the software that has been developed.

Imagine if we grabbed four drivers from four different cars and put them into one car. That would now prevent those three cars from being the source of the traffic jam. We need to figure out a reward system that will reward drivers who will do carpool and companies that will schedule employees at similar time, so they can carpool.2) The speed limit of freeways is also another issue. When we have a freeway that has the speed limit of 55, as soon as congestion starts occurring, the speed starts dropping down to 45,35,25 in one hour, for instance. Now, if the speed limit was 75, if because of the congestion, the speed starts dropping down, within an hour, it might only drop down to 65, 55, 45 - which is waaayyy better than going 25mph.3) Have cities approve the self driving cars. Humans are very accident prone and having self driving cars have much less accidents, close to none. A lot of times, when an accident occurs, two things happenFirst, the drivers don't move out of the way, and cars have to switch lanes, causing major congestion.Second, the drivers will move out of the way. However, the spectators will slow down just to see the accident. That causes a domino effect, which causes a traffic jam miles behind.",Microsoft Research,en,0.9650295376777648

I would like a device that could also interact and show info on a mirrior, such as weather info, time a show/news/ video and it be able to be controlled by air hand gestures. I think the best way at least as of now is by using a method that resembles the Xbox connect. It would also need a projector method though as well, although the screen would almost have to be in the mirror, because of reflections idk though. look at rear view mirror which allow you to push them down and new rear view mirror have auto blinding assistance.
