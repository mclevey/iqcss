Of incandescent plasma

No, no, no

The sun is a quagmire
It's not made of fire
Forget what you've been told in the past

Fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid

i like the idea of learning more about what peer pressure can do and turning it into something positive. 

Two negative examples on how extremely powerful peer pressure can be: just think about WW2 / the holocaust, and about mass cult suicides.Ive been aware of the negative aspect of peer pressure for a long time now, and it causes me to try to immunize myself against peer pressure and be individualistic.

well, it might be scary, but doesnt that just make it a fact that you should be aware of? It has always been excessively used in the military, and in cults and religious groups and gangs.

Yes it seems someone is getting defensive, judging by the caps, and your last resort to grammar and spelling corrections, in an attempt to divert attention for your unjustified obnoxious behavior.

You do that.

""Deserve"", is a perceptive concept, at that, no one, meaning herself, her fans, me, or any other on this page who supports her has said she works harder then anyone. So what is the relevance this? Are you merely here just to say she deserves nothing she has?

I don't think Gaga is ""high on Xanax"". lol. I'd probably be the same in this situation.
As for showing so much skin, that's her prerogative. If you're not a fan of her skin or gay-friendly lyrics, that's your prerogative. But those aren't the things that make her my role model.
It's that she can accept people for who they are and be herself, and also the fact that she is a genuine musician w/out auto-tuning.

Music doesn't influence your actions. Just as absurd as saying certain games will make you not kill people, but halo will. 

If I'm correct, scrolling down you can clearly see yourself calling someone else a ""fucktard"". Obviously there is no difference in influence. One just happens to be more mainstream, and more popular.

hi. please note that democracy is a type of government control on society. The founders of America stated they disliked democracy.  

You can search google if you don’t believe me. When America was born it was a republic. A republic gives individuals freedom to work and keep their income. This is the reason why America was once the source innovation in various industries. America once manufactured everything.

I mean the host dude is so out of his league to begin with but you just kind of learn from watching this that Conan must REALLY hold back when he's interviewing celebrities and that he could probably just mock and ridicule most of them non-stop... but he doesn't.

He's completely playing to the audience. How to impress google employees: 1. Make infinite jokes about their doofus of a boss/superior. 2. Talk about how much the internet has been underestimated/dismissed by big broadcasting companies. 3. Insult their arrogance — then give in and play clown for them. Repeatedly. 4. Intellectualize Twitter comedy. 5. Flatter the pants off them.,Talks at Google,en,0.9779931306838988

I see a problem with the zoom-function. First you show it being controlled with the tilt-motion and later it seems to be a pinch gesture, whereas the tilt has become the crop-function. Better keep the tilt-motion the zoom and make the shake the crop-function, whilst the pinch is the framing. I can imagine a good path to go would be, designing the tilt as dimensional-regulatory control, the shake as a trigger and the finger as the tool.
