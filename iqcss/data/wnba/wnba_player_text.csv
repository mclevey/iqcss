As a junior, Canada continued to grow in to one of the best point guards in the country. She notched her first career triple-double with 11 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds against Southern on Nov. 18, 2016, and nearly did it again two days later, finishing with 19 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists against Cal Poly.

She won a gold medal in women's 3x3 basketball at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[2][3] She played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels and South Carolina Gamecocks. After she was selected 4th overall by the Wings in the 2017 WNBA draft, Gray won the WNBA Rookie of the Year award. Early life[edit] She was a member of the U18 USA Basketball National Team as well as the 3-on-3 National Team. Named 3A state player of the year three times. She led Washington County to a three-year record of 88-4 that included a perfect 32-0 record and a 3A state championship in 2010-11. As a junior, Gray averaged 32.0 points and 8.5 rebounds en route to a state runner-up finish. She then missed most of her senior season with a knee injury College career[edit] Heavily recruited by power programs, she was ranked the 7th overall player as part of a high-profile 2013 recruiting class. After receiving offers from Maryland, Kentucky, South Carolina, etc., she eventually chose to attend North Carolina to play for Coach Sylvia Hatchell. After two years in Chapel Hill, Gray shockingly announced that she would be transferring. It was then reported that her reason for transferring was due to UNC's athletic-academic scandal. In May 2015, it was announced that Gray had transferred to South Carolina to play for Dawn Staley. Gray eventually won a National Championship in her first season of eligibility. Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] After helping lead South Carolina to the NCAA Championship, Gray opted to enter the 2017 WNBA draft. By entering, she would forgo her final season of college eligibility.[4] She was drafted 4th overall by the Dallas Wings placing her in the city where she won a national title two weeks prior, and eventually pairing her with South Carolina teammate, Kaela Davis, who was selected 10th. In her rookie season, Gray immediately entered the Wings' starting lineup at the shooting guard. She started in all 34 games and averaged 13.1 ppg. On August 12, 2017, Gray scored a career-high 21 points in a 96-88 loss to the Connecticut Sun.[5] The Wings finished as the number 7 seed in the league with a 16-18 record. The Wings were defeated in the first round elimination game 86-76 by the Washington Mystics. On September 19, 2017, it was announced by the WNBA that Gray won the 2017 Rookie of the Year Award.[6] Gray with the Dallas Wings in 2021 In her second season, Gray continued her starting role with the Wings. With the arrival of all-star center Liz Cambage, Gray would have a reduced offensive load on the team. Gray averaged 9.2 ppg in her second season, helping the Wings to the number 8 seed with a 15-19 record. In the first round elimination game, the Wings lost 101-83 to the Phoenix Mercury. In January 2023, Gray was traded to the Atlanta Dream in exchange for draft picks.[7] Overseas[edit] In June 2018, Gray signed with Elitzur Ramla of the Israeli League for the 2018-19 off-season.[8] Unrivaled[edit] On August 22, 2024, it was announced that Gray would appear and play in the inaugural season of Unrivaled, a new women's 3-on-3 basketball league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.[9][10] She plays for Lunar Owls.

Griner dunked 52 times in 32 games as a senior, setting a single-game record of seven dunks against Aldine High School.[31] Houston mayor Bill White declared May 7, 2009, Brittney Griner Day.[32] On November 11, 2008, she recorded 25 blocks in a game against Houston Alief Hastings, the most ever recorded by a female in a high school game in the U.S.[30] In her 2008-09 season, she recorded 318 blocks, a single-season record.[33] Griner was named a WBCA All-American and participated in the 2009 WBCA High School All-America Game, leading the team by scoring 20 points and collecting 9 rebounds.[34] College career Griner played college basketball at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. As a freshman, Griner's 223 blocked shots set the all-time single-season record, establishing her as one of the greatest shot blockers in women's basketball history.[35] On December 16, 2009, Griner recorded Baylor's first triple-double[36] with 34 points, 13 rebounds, and Big 12 Conference record 11 blocked shots. In January 2010, she became only the seventh player to dunk during a women's college basketball game,[37] and only the second woman to dunk twice in a single college game, making the second and third dunks of her college career[38] in a lopsided 99-18 victory against Texas State University. On March 3, 2010, Griner and Texas Tech player Jordan Barncastle were battling for position near the lane. As a foul was being called on Barncastle, Griner took two steps forward and threw a right-handed roundhouse punch which broke Barncastle's nose. Griner was then ejected from the game. Lady Bears coach Kim Mulkey then imposed another one-game suspension in addition to the one-game suspension mandated by NCAA rules.[39][40] Baylor entered the NCAA Tournament as a 4th seed, and knocked off top-seeded Tennessee in the Sweet 16. On March 22, Griner set an NCAA tournament record with 14 blocked shots in a 49-33 win against the Georgetown Hoyas.[41] In the Elite Eight, Baylor defeated Duke 51-48, and Griner blocked 9 shots, totaling 35 for the tournament, a new NCAA Women's Tournament record.

Griner was named an AP Second Team All-American.[43] As a sophomore, Griner received First Team All-American honors after averaging 23 points a game, including a career-high 40 points against Green Bay in the Sweet 16.[44] Her sophomore season ended with a 48-56 loss to the eventual national champion and conference rival, Texas A&M University. In her junior season, Griner averaged 23.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 5 blocks per game.[44] She blocked more shots than any other Division I women's team that season.[45] Griner was named AP Player of the Year[46] and The 2012 Premier Player of Women's College Basketball. On April 3, 2012, Griner led Baylor with 26 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocked shots to win the Division I Women's Basketball Championship, 80-61 over Notre Dame. Griner was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. Baylor finished its undefeated season with 40 wins, the most in NCAA history.[47] After winning the championship on April 3, 2012, Griner decided to withdraw her candidacy for a roster spot on the 2012 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team. A month later Griner broke her wrist after jumping off her skateboard when she was going down a ramp.[48] Her college career came to an end in the 2013 NCAA women's basketball tournament when Baylor lost to the University of Louisville Cardinals during her senior year, in the Sweet 16.[49] She later received her bachelor's degree in education in 2019.[50] College statistics † NCAA championship ‡ NCAA record Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2009-10 Baylor 35 35 33.5 .503 .000 .684 8.5 1.0 0.5 6.4 2.8 18.4 2010-11 Baylor 37 37 31.8 .543 .500 .777 7.8 1.4 0.4 4.6 2.1 23.0 2011-12† Baylor 40 40 32.7 .609 .500 .800 9.5 1.6 0.6 5.2 1.7 23.2 2012-13 Baylor 36 36 30.3 .607 .000 .712 9.4 2.4 0.7 4.1 1.9 23.8 Career 148 148 32.0 .569 .400 .747 8.8 1.6 0.5 5.1 1.4 22.2 Year Rebounds Blocks Points Notable stats.

In her debut on May 27, 2013, against Chicago Sky, Griner equaled the WNBA dunk record, recording two dunks to equal Candace Parker's career total.[53] She thus became the third WNBA player to dunk and first to do so twice in one game.[54] She was a dominant defensive force in the league over the season, averaging 3.0 blocks per game. Griner was named a WNBA All-Star, but missed the 2013 WNBA All-Star Game with a right knee injury, and was replaced by Tina Thompson.[55] In April 2013, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he would consider drafting Griner to the NBA, and Griner expressed interest in the opportunity, but no offer to try out was extended by the team.[56] 2014 In the 2014 season, Griner's stats would improve, as she averaged 15.6 points per game, 8.0 rebounds per game and 3.7 blocks per game. On June 29, 2014, Griner had set a WNBA record with 11 blocks in a regular season game win against the Tulsa Shock, along with 21 points and 8 rebounds.[57] On August 24, 2014, Griner became the first WNBA player to dunk in a playoff game when she helped the Mercury defeat the Los Angeles Sparks, 93-68, at Staples Center.[58] The 2014 season would be a historic season for the Mercury with the combination of Brittney Griner, Diana Taurasi and Candice Dupree as the dominant Big 3 to carry the team plus the arrival of new head coach Sandy Brondello, the Mercury finished 29-5, setting the WNBA record for most wins in a regular season.

Although the Mercury were playing without their all-star guard Diana Taurasi (who sat out the season to play overseas), the Mercury still made it to the playoffs. In the 2015 playoffs, Griner set a WNBA playoff record with 11 blocks (along with 18 points and 8 rebounds) in a game 1 victory against the Tulsa Shock, whom she also had 11 blocks against in a regular season game the year before.[60] The Mercury advanced to the second round where they were swept by the Minnesota Lynx who won the championship that year. 2016 In the 2016 season, with the return of Diana Taurasi, the Mercury had a more successful playoff run. En route to the playoffs, Griner averaged 14.5 points per game, 6.5 rebounds per game and 3.1 blocks per game as the Mercury finished 16-18. During the season, Griner had recorded the sixth triple-double in WNBA history in a win against the Atlanta Dream where she had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 blocks.[61] With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Mercury were the number 8 seed in the league as they faced the Indiana Fever in the first round.

After 12 games played, Griner left the bubble for undisclosed personal reasons.[66] Without Griner, the Mercury finished 13-9 as the number 5 seed. They would make it as far as the second round where they lost to the Minnesota Lynx in the elimination game. 2021 In 2021 during the regular season, the Mercury were the 4th seed in the Western Conference, going 19-13, with Griner averaging 20.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 32.8 minutes per game in the season, while playing 30 of 36 games.[67][68][69] She scored the most points in the playoffs, 240 points, helping the Mercury beat the New York Liberty, Seattle Storm, the first seed Las Vegas Aces and helping the Mercury reach the WNBA finals, where they lost to the Chicago Sky in 4 games.[70][71][72][73] 2023 Griner missed the entire 2022 season because she was incarcerated on drug charges in Russia. She was released in December as part of a prisoner swap between the United States and Russia. In 2023 Griner performed well, and was named a starter in the 2023 WNBA All-Star Game.[74] The Mercury finished in last place with a 9-31 record. She appeared in 31 of the team's 40 games, averaging 17.5 points per game and 6.3 rebounds per game. 2025 It was reported on January 28th, 2025 that Griner would be signing a 1 year deal with the Atlanta Dream in the free agency off season.[75] Overseas Griner has played overseas in the WNBA off-season.[76] In the 2013-14 off-season, she played in China for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of the WCBA where she signed a four-month contract for $600,000, which was 12 times the amount she made in her rookie season with the Mercury.[77] She was named as the MVP of the 2014 WCBA All-Star Game.[78] In the 2014-15 off-season, she played in China for the Beijing Great Wall of the WCBA.

On March 3rd, Griner recorded the first dunk in Unrivaled history.[85] National team career In September 2011, Griner spent two weeks playing under coach Geno Auriemma for the U.S. national team as part of its European training tour. Griner was the only college player in the group.[86] She averaged 12.8 points and 7.3 rebounds a game with the U.S. team in Europe.[48] Griner was the sole player still playing in college on the 2012 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team finalists roster.[87] Excluding Griner, the average age on the finalists roster was approximately 30 years, while Griner was 22 years old at the time of the Olympics. Griner decided in April 2012 not to participate in the 2012 Olympics due to family illness and her school schedule.[88] In 2016, she played for the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team at the Summer Olympics and earned her first Olympic gold medal as they beat Spain 101-72 in the final, becoming one of 11 players who have earned an Olympic gold medal, FIBA World Cup gold medal, WNBA title, an NCAA title, joining Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Tamika Catchings, Cynthia Cooper, Asjha Jones, Maya Moore, Breanna Stewart, Sheryl Swoopes, Diana Taurasi, and Kara Wolters on the list.[86] Griner was selected for her second Olympics in 2021,[89] going undefeated and winning the gold medal as part of Team USA.[3] In June 2024, Griner was again named to the US women's Olympic team to compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in France.[90] She contributed four points[91] to help the United States defeat France 67-66 in the final, earning Griner her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and the United States' eighth consecutive gold medal.[92] During the medal ceremony when the U.S. national anthem was played, Griner would get emotional at the event, thinking she wouldn't even be here again following her previous arrest in Russia back in 2022.[93][94][95] Honors Along with being selected as the number-one high school player in the country by Rivals.com, Griner was featured on the cover of ESPN's Rise magazine,[96] and was selected by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association as the 2009 State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year.[96] Griner also won the 2013 ESPY Award for best female college athlete. She was the 2012 winner of the Honda Sports Award for basketball[97][98] and the overall Honda-Broderick Cup winner for all sports.[99] She was the 2012 recipient of the Wade Trophy, presented to the best female NCAA Division I basketball player who embodies the ""Spirit of Margaret Wade"".[100] She was the winner of the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award, in 2012, and again in 2013.[101] The award is given by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association to the nation's top Division I women's player.[102] Among other accolades, Griner is credited with bringing the women's game more attention due to her ability to dunk.[103] She holds the NCAA record for dunks in a career with 18 total dunks.[104] She passed Candace Parker as the all-time NCAA women's dunks leader.[105] 2009--WBCA High School Coaches' All-America Team[106] 2011--WBCA NCAA Division I Defensive Player of the Year[107] 2012--WBCA NCAA Division I Defensive Player of the Year[107] 2013--WBCA NCAA Division I Defensive Player of the Year[107] 2014--FIBA World Championship All-Star Five[108] In 2014, Griner was included as part of The Advocate's annual ""40 under 40"" list.[109] The WNBA included Griner in The W25, a list of the best players of the league's first 25 years.[110] She was also named one of ESPNW's Impact 25 in 2014.[111] In February 2024, Baylor University retired Griner's No. 42 jersey in a ceremony preceding a game versus Texas Tech.[112] Personal life and activism In an interview with SI.com on February 11, 2013, Griner publicly came out as a lesbian.[113] She also revealed in the interview that she was bullied as a child, explaining, ""It's hard. Just being picked on for being different. Just being bigger, my sexuality, everything."" She said she is very passionate about working with children in order to bring attention to the issue of bullying, particularly against LGBT people.[113] Griner had previously come out to her parents in high school, which her father did not accept gracefully, forcing her to live with an assistant coach for six weeks during her senior year.[114] She later wrote a memoir with Sue Hovey addressing bullying and self-acceptance, In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court, published in 2014.[114][115] In a 2019 interview with People, Griner stated, ""People tell me I'm going to break the barrier and trailblaze. I just kind of look at it like, I'm just trying to help out, I'm just trying to make it not as tough for the next generation.""[116] In 2013, Griner was featured on the cover of ESPN Magazine. She appeared in ""The Taboo Issue"".[117] She is pictured holding a snake, which is her favorite animal because they are ""misunderstood"".[118] She says, ""You just have to look at it in a different way.""[118] Her endorsement deal with Nike was the first time the company had signed such a deal with an openly gay athlete.[119] Griner continues to push back on traditional gender roles as she regularly models clothes branded as ""menswear"" for Nike.[118] Nike spokesman Brian Strong said of signing Griner, ""We can't get into specifics, but it's safe to say we jumped at the opportunity to work with her because she breaks the mold.""[118] In 2020, Griner, along with teammate Brianna Turner, called for the WNBA to stop playing the United States national anthem before the games. She made her remarks after Mercury players refused to take the floor during a pre-season game in Bradenton, Florida. Griner said she was protesting the killing of Breonna Taylor as part of the wider George Floyd protests.[120] She said later during a media teleconference, ""I honestly feel we should not play the national anthem during our season. I think we should take that much of a stand.""[121] She said she does not believe that the national anthem should be played at sporting events.[122] Since her release from detention in Russia in December 2022, Griner has championed the return of others detained in foreign countries;[123] she has also stated her experiences of being detained in a Russian jail have led her to appreciate the ""uniquely American freedoms"" citizens of her country take for granted or overlook. As such, she resumed standing for the national anthem beginning with the 2023 season.[124] On February 17, 2025, Griner cancelled a speaking engagement for a cannabis leadership summit at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, after a piece of duct tape with the words ""Gay Baby Jail"" written on it was found near her hotel room, which she perceived to be a threat. According to detectives at the Prince George's County Police Department, the words ""Gay Baby Jail"" was an apparent video game reference, and may have been connected to a large anime and video game convention that had recently taken place at the event center.[125][126] Previous marriage and disorderly conduct case On August 14, 2014, Griner got engaged to fellow WNBA player Glory Johnson.[127][128] On April 22, 2015, they were both arrested on charges of assault and disorderly conduct after police responded to a fight between the two in their suburban home in Phoenix, Arizona. Both had sustained minor injuries.[129][130] Despite this incident, they married the following month on May 8, 2015, in Phoenix.[131][132] On May 15, 2015, the WNBA suspended Griner and Johnson for seven games each after Griner pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges. Griner was also required to complete 26 weeks of domestic violence counseling.[133] On June 4, 2015, Griner and Johnson revealed that Johnson was pregnant with twins,[134] conceived with Johnson's eggs through in vitro fertilization.[135] The following day, and after less than a month of marriage, Griner filed for an annulment of the marriage citing fraud and duress;[136] the annulment was denied.[137] Johnson gave birth to twin girls on October 12, 2015, 16 weeks premature.[138] Griner was ordered to pay child support to Johnson.[138] The couple's divorce was finalized in June 2016.[139] Marriage Griner became engaged to Cherelle Watson in August 2018,[140] and they married in June 2019.[139] In 2024, Griner and her wife Cherelle announced a pregnancy.[141] In July 2024, Cherelle gave birth to a boy, whom they named Bash.[142][143] 2022 arrest and imprisonment in Russia Main article: Viktor Bout-Brittney Griner prisoner exchange On February 17, 2022, Griner was arrested on drug smuggling charges in Russia. She was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport after the Federal Customs Service found she was carrying vaporizer cartridges containing less than a gram of hash oil. In Arizona, she had been prescribed medicinal cannabis, which is illegal in Russia.[144][18][145][146] Some U.S. officials expressed concern that Russia may have been using Griner as leverage in response to the international sanctions imposed against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The former Pentagon official Evelyn Farkas expressed concern that Griner could be used as a ""high-profile hostage"" by Russia.[147][148] In May 2022, the U.S. State Department stated that they had determined Griner was being ""wrongfully detained"".[149] On May 15, 2022, it was reported that the United States and Russia would consider a prisoner swap, with Russia exchanging Griner for arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had served 10 years of a 25-year federal prison sentence in the United States, on charges of conspiracy to kill American citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization.[150] Trial, sentencing, imprisonment, and release Fans at the 2022 NWSL Championship were invited to write letters to Griner. On the second day of her trial, July 7, 2022, Griner pleaded guilty[a] but said she had no intent to break the law. Griner requested that she be allowed to give testimony to the court.[152][151] On August 4, 2022, the court found Griner guilty and sentenced her to nine years in prison and fined her 1 million rubles (US$16,301), even though the standard sentence for possession of no more than 2 grams of hash oil is 15 days.[19][153] On November 17, Griner's lawyers said that she was transferred to IK-2, a female penal colony in the town of Yavas in the region of Mordovia[20] (previously, she had been held at an undisclosed location).[154] Griner's family enlisted the help of Bring Our Families Home to appeal for her release.[21] On December 8, 2022, she was released by Russia in a 1-for-1 prisoner swap for Viktor Bout.[22] At the same time as the exchange, Russia deported another American, Sarah Krivanek, detained for a domestic violence dispute.[155][156] WNBA career statistics Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader † Denotes season(s) in which Griner won a WNBA championship ‡ WNBA record Regular season WNBA regular season statistics[157] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2013 Phoenix 27 27 25.9 .556 -- .724 6.3 1.0 0.4 3.0 degrees 1.7 14.5 2014† Phoenix 34 34 30.7 .578 -- .802 8.0 1.6 0.6 3.7 degrees 1.9 15.6 2015 Phoenix 26 26 30.7 .565 -- .773 8.1 1.3 0.3 4.0‡ 2.1 15.1 2016 Phoenix 34 34 29.2 .548 -- .831 6.5 1.0 0.3 3.1 degrees 2.0 14.5 2017 Phoenix 26 26 31.5 .577 -- .812 7.6 1.9 0.6 2.5 degrees 2.4 21.9 2018 Phoenix 34 34 32.6 .544 .250 .800 7.7 2.1 0.5 2.6 degrees 2.3 20.5 2019 Phoenix 31 31 32.8 .564 .333 .808 7.2 2.4 0.7 2.0 degrees 2.4 20.7 degrees 2020 Phoenix 12 12 31.8 .497 .000 .809 7.5 3.0 0.3 1.8 2.5 17.7 2021 Phoenix 30 30 32.8 .575 .444 .846 9.5 2.7 0.4 1.9 degrees 2.2 20.5 2022 Did not appear in league (detained abroad) 2023 Phoenix 31 31 27.6 .579 degrees .111 .772 6.3 2.2 0.5 1.6 2.1 17.5 2024 Phoenix 30 30 28.7 .579 degrees .500 .777 6.6 2.3 0.5 1.5 1.8 17.8 Career 11 years, 1 team 315 315 30.4 .562 .364 .799 7.4 1.9 0.5 2.6 2.1 17.7 All-Star 7 5 15.5 .593 .176 .500 7.1 0.9 0.3 1.4 0.9 15.1 Playoffs WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2013 Phoenix 5 5 26.6 .533 -- .556 6.4 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.6 10.6 2014† Phoenix 7 7 31.0 .627 -- .920 6.0 1.6 0.4 3.4 degrees 1.8 16.7 2015 Phoenix 4 4 29.7 .583 -- .885 8.0 1.3 0.7 4.5 degrees 2.0 16.3 2016 Phoenix 5 5 31.2 .643 -- .813 6.0 1.6 0.6 2.2 2.2 13.4 2017 Phoenix 5 5 36.8 .407 -- .795 7.0 2.0 0.6 1.6 2.4 20.2 2018 Phoenix 7 7 36.4 .631 -- .750 8.0 3.1 0.7 2.2 1.7 21.6 2019 Phoenix 1 1 13.8 .375 -- -- 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 6.0 2021 Phoenix 11 11 35.1 .562 .000 .800 8.4 3.0 0.4 1.6 2.1 21.8 2024 Phoenix 2 2 29.5 .520 .500 .700 5.5 0.0 0.5 2.0 2.0 17.0 Career 9 years, 1 team 47 47 32.4 .560 .167 .803 7.1 1.9 0.5 2.2 2.0 17.7 Books Griner, Brittney; Hovey, Sue (April 8, 2014).

She played college basketball at South Carolina and Oregon. High school career[edit] Paopao played basketball for La Jolla Country Day School in La Jolla, San Diego, California. As a 10 year old, Paopao was the starting point guard for a U16 team. When she was 14 years old, Kelsey Plum said of Paopao, ""She's just never scared. It's like a fearlessness but a confidence that she has... I think she could start in the Pac-12 right now... Honestly, I think she could be the best to come out of San Diego."" Plum would often invite Paopao to train with her, stating ""Even to this day, when I go back, that's the only kid I would let work out with me, because she can hang with the intensity... She pushes me because I'm like, 'I can't let a 12-year-old beat me in this shooting drill.""[1] However, she suffered a torn ACL in each of her first two high school seasons.[2] As a senior, Paopao averaged 22.7 points, 8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 3.3 steals per game. She led her team to a 32-1 record and the Southern California Open Division regional title, but the state championship game was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Paopao received McDonald's All-American honors and was named California Gatorade Player of the Year and California Ms. Basketball.[3][4] Rated a five-star recruit by ESPN, she committed to playing college basketball for Oregon over offers from California, Oregon State and UCLA, among other programs.[5] College career[edit] Paopao entered her freshman season as Oregon's starting point guard, replacing Sabrina Ionescu. Kelly Graves, head coach of Oregon, had high praise for her: ""I think Te-Hina is next in the line of those guards that we've had that can just fill up the stat sheet. She's a good rebounder, an excellent passer, an elite-level shooter,"" Graves said. ""I'm not saying she's another Sabrina, but she's got the ability to impact the game in multiple ways like Sabrina did."" She had chosen Oregon over other programs because Oregon had not stopped recruiting her amidst the injuries she faced through high school.[6] She was part of the top-recruiting class, being one of the five five-start recruits, dubbed the ""Fab Five"". As a freshman, she started all games played and averaged 10.2 points, 4.4 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game, missing her last five games with a foot injury.[7] Paopao earned All-Pac-12 honors and All-Freshmen selection - being one of only two players in the league to earn both honors. She also led all NCAA freshmen with a 2.40 assist-to-turnover ratio while ranking fourth in the Pac-12 in assists per game. Paopao with South Carolina in 2024 As a sophomore, Paopao was sidelined early in the season due to injury. She averaged 13.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, repeating as an All-Pac-12 selection.[4] She repeated with All-Pac-12 honors in her sophomore year.[8] By sophomore year, all the other four five-star recruits from Paopao's recruiting class had transferred out of Oregon. However, Paopao confirmed her stance to stay with the Oregon program.[9] Two years later in a podcast, she revealed that while her family had encouraged her to transfer as well, she chose to stay to be 'loyal' to the program who had stuck with her through her high school injuries.[10] In her junior season, Paopao averaged 13.1 points, 4.2 rebounds 3.3 assists per game, earning All-Pac-12 honorable mention.[11] Te-hina had faced a 6 game shooting slump this season,[12] she later talks about how it had affected her mental health.[10] Despite the slump, her 3PT% stats still concluded at 44%.[13] Paopao with South Carolina before the 2024 NCAA championship game For her senior season, she transferred out of Oregon and was recruited by Dawn Staley to South Carolina for her 3-point shooting skills, leadership and experience.[14] Staley has commented on the impact of Paopao on their team, ""It makes a big difference for someone like Pao, who is always calm, cool, collected. You know what her capabilities are. You know that you've got to guard her. She doesn't take bad shots, so it's great to have that on the floor and great to get our starting five back together just playing as a cohesive unit.""[15] At the end of the regular season, Paopao was the nation's top percentage 3-point shooter, hitting a career-high 48.6 percent from beyond the arc, and is among the SEC's top 10 with 3.8 assists per game. She leads the SEC and is 19th in the nation in player offensive rating (Her Hoop Stats). Her 11.5 points per game include 15 games shooting at least 50.0 percent from the field and 11 games of at least three 3-pointers. In six games against ranked opponents, she is the Gamecocks' top scorer at 15.0 points per game on 48.7 percent 3-point shooting. On the season, her 11.5 points per game and the 8.8 points per game teammates score on her assists, means Paopao has had her hand on 23.2 percent of the Gamecocks' total offense. Against ranked opponents, that number rises to 29.8 percent. Paopao was named as ""Finalist"" for the Nancy Lieberman Award, alongside Georgia Amoore, Caitlin Clark, Hannah Hidalgo, and Jacy Sheldon.[16] After Senior Day, Te-Hina declared that she will be returning for her fifth year of eligibility.[17] Professional career[edit] On April 14, 2025, Paopao was drafted by the Atlanta Dream with the eighteenth pick in the second round.[18] National team career[edit] Paopao represented the United States at the 2021 FIBA Under-19 Women's Basketball World Cup in Hungary. She averaged 9.1 points, 4.6 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game, helping her team win the gold medal.[19] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game TO Turnovers per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led Division I College[edit] Te-Hina Paopao NCAA Statistics[20] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2020-21 Oregon 19 19 28.4 .433 .462 .800 3.2 4.4 1.4 0.3 1.8 10.2 2021-22 Oregon 23 22 32.7 .387 .300 .870 4.0 3.3 1.1 0.1 2.0 13.6 2022-23 Oregon 35 35 32.5 .440 .424 .880 4.2 3.3 1.3 0.3 1.8 13.1 2023-24 South Carolina 37 37 27.4 .461 .468* .848 2.6 3.7 0.8 0.2 1.6 11.0 2024-25 South Carolina 38 38 25.1 .450 .371 .737 2.7 2.9 1.1 0.3 1.2 9.6 Career 152 151 28.9 .435 .400 .836 3.3 3.4 1.1 0.3 1.7 11.4 Personal life[edit] Paopao is of Samoan and Tokelauan descent.[21] Her uncle, Joe Salave'a, played in the National Football League as a defensive tackle before becoming a college football coach.[2] She is a cousin of softball player Megan Faraimo.[22] References[edit] External links[edit] Oregon Ducks bio South Carolina Gamecocks bio Retrieved from ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Te-Hina_Paopao&oldid=1301213897"""

Allen was a member of the Australian Women's basketball team (Opals) at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Opals were eliminated after losing to the USA in the quarterfinals.[1] Early life[edit] Allen was born in Wangaratta, Victoria and moved to Melbourne with her family when she was five years old.[2] She is a dizygotic twin.[3] She played in the junior competition for the suburb Nunawading. Allen was sought out by the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) at the age of 16.[4] Career[edit] WNBL[edit] In the domestic Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), Allen has played for the Dandenong Rangers (2009-2010), Australian Institute of Sport (2010-2012), Melbourne Boomers (2012-2015) and South East Queensland Stars (2015-2016).[5] In 2014, Allen was awarded the WNBL Robyn Maher Defensive Player of the Year.[6] Alongside the WNBL, in Australia Allen played with the Knox Raiders for the 2013 SEABL Season where the team took home the Championship. Allen starred and was awarded the Barbara Barton (Grand Final MVP) medal. She was previously awarded the 2011 SEABL Youth Player of the Year.[7] WNBA[edit] New York Liberty (2015-2022)[edit] After her success at the World Championship, where she won a bronze medal, Allen signed as a free agent with the New York Liberty for the 2015 WNBA season.[8] She made her WNBA debut in the Liberty's 2015 season opener against Atlanta, scoring six points.[9] Shortly into the 2015 season, Allen suffered a season-ending right knee cartilage injury and decided to return home to Australia to undergo surgery.[10] Connecticut Sun (2023)[edit] Allen was traded to the Connecticut Sun in January 2023, as part of a three-team deal.[11] Phoenix Mercury (2024)[edit] On 3 February 2024, the Connecticut Sun traded Allen to the Phoenix Mercury in a sign-and-trade deal in exchange for Moriah Jefferson.[12] Allen played in only 18 games all season. She struggled with injuries, and a hamstring injury sustained in July while preparing for the Paris Olympics tournament kept her sidelined for the rest of the regular season.[13] She was officially ruled out of the postseason after undergoing surgery to address her lingering back issues.[14] Chicago Sky (2025-present)[edit] On 2 February 2025, Allen was traded to the Connecticut Sun. The deal was originally reported as Allen, Natasha Cloud, and the 12th pick in the 2025 WNBA draft being traded in exchange for Alyssa Thomas and Tyasha Harris;[15] however, it was officially part of a larger four-team trade.[16] Subsequently, on 4 February 2025, Allen was traded to the Chicago Sky in exchange for Lindsay Allen and the rights to Nikolina Milić.[17] LIGA FEMENINA ENDESA[edit] In 2020, after the pandemic, she signed with the Spanish team, Valencia Basket. National Team[edit] Youth Level[edit] Allen made her debut for the Gems at the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Championship for Women held in Chile.[18] Senior Level[edit] Allen is a current member of the Australian Women's basketball squad.[5] Following good form in preliminary lead-up games, Allen was selected to represent the Opals at the 2014 World Championship held in Turkey where she would make her national team debut.[19] In 2019, Allen was named to the final roster for the 2019 FIBA Asia Cup.[20] After strong showings throughout this tournament, Allen was named to the tournament All-Star Five.[21] Allen, like all the other members of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Opals women's basketball team, had a difficult tournament. The Opals lost their first two group stage matches. They looked flat against Belgium and then lost to China in heartbreaking circumstances. In their last group match the Opals needed to beat Puerto Rico by 25 or more in their final match to progress. This they did by 27 in a very exciting match. However, they lost to the United States in their quarterfinal 79 to 55.[22] Allen was in the squad for the 2024 Paris Olympics tournament. However, a hamstring injury sustained in the final warm-up game ruled her out of the tournament.[13] Personal life[edit] Allen completed a Masters in Marketing at Deakin University.[23] Allen joined the NBL commentary team for the 2024-25 season.[24] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[25] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2015 New York 2 0 17.0 .300 .000 -- 4.5 0.0 1.5 1.0 1.5 3.0 2016 New York 21 6 13.3 .459 .567 .867 1.7 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.6 5.7 2017 New York 33 0 9.2 .376 .341 .333 2.0 0.5 0.3 0.3 0.5 2.8 2018 New York 28 0 10.4 .376 .263 .840 1.7 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.5 3.8 2019 New York 24 2 17.2 .417 .426 .813 2.5 0.7 0.5 0.7 0.7 7.2 2020 Did not play (opted out) 2021 New York 25 13 24.6 .343 .381 .892 3.7 1.1 1.6 1.2 0.8 9.2 2022 New York 25 19 20.9 .379 .313 .833 3.4 1.2 0.8 1.0 1.0 7.0 2023 Connecticut 40 27 21.5 .408 .348 .704 2.8 0.9 0.9 1.3 0.9 6.4 2024 Phoenix 18 18 24.8 .417 .352 .667 3.9 1.1 0.9 0.7 1.0 7.4 Career 9 years, 3 teams 216 85 17.4 .392 .363 .804 2.7 0.8 0.7 0.8 0.8 6.0 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2017 New York 1 0 6.7 1.000 1.000 -- 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 2021 New York 1 1 29.0 .500 .600 -- 4.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 degrees 0.0 11.0 2022 New York 3 0 16.3 .286 .167 1.000 3.0 1.3 0.7 0.3 1.0 4.3 2023 Connecticut 6 6 30.8 .489 .423 1.000 5.5 1.7 1.5 1.5 1.0 9.7 2024 Phoenix Did not play (injury) Career 4 years, 2 teams 11 7 24.5 .457 .421 1.000 4.2 1.3 1.1 1.3 0.8 7.7 See also[edit] List of Australian WNBA players References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Rebecca Allen.

Banham played guard for the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball team, where she set a number of team records. Banham was drafted by the Connecticut Sun with the 4th pick of the 2016 WNBA draft.[1] Banham was traded to the Minnesota Lynx in 2020,[2] and later re-signed with the Sun in 2024. Early life[edit] Banham was born on July 15, 1993, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[3] Banham went to Lakeville North High School in Lakeville, Minnesota and graduated in 2011. She started on the varsity basketball team as an 8th grade student. During her senior year, she averaged 17.8 points per game, 5.3 rebounds, and four assists. With these numbers she led her squad to a 29-3 record and a conference championship.[4] College career[edit] After graduating from high school, Banham continued her education and basketball career at the University of Minnesota. Banham started all 36 games her freshman year, and was named Freshman All American First Team and Big Ten Freshman of the Year. During her freshman year, (2011-2012) she averaged 16.1 points per game which ranked her 97th in the nation. Her sophomore year (2012-2013) she averaged 20.7 points per game which was good enough for second-leading sophomore scorer in NCAA Division I. As a Junior (2013-2014) Banham averaged 22.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game. At the start of her senior season (2014-2015) Banham had only played 10 games before she suffered a season ending ACL injury. Before she tore her ACL, Banham was on ESPN's top 5 players to watch in the upcoming season. She later received a medical hardship waiver so she could play in the 2015-2016 season. When she returned to the court in the 2015-2016 season for her senior year, she had an outstanding season. Banham was named Big Ten Player of the Year and was a John R. Wooden Award finalist.[5] Despite her time off because of her injury, Banham came back to become the Gophers all-time leading scorer and tied an NCAA record with a 60-point game against Northwestern on February 7, 2016.[6] Banham ended her college career on a high note, becoming the sixth-leading scorer in NCAA Division I women's history and the Big Ten Conference's all-time scoring leader at the end of her college career with 3,093 points. (As of the end of the 2017-18 season, she is now eighth on the career scoring list, having since been surpassed by Washington's Kelsey Plum (2013-17), now the D-I all-time scoring leader,[7] and new Big Ten career scoring leader Kelsey Mitchell of Ohio State (2015-18).[8]) Banham's senior year was not only one of the most memorable seasons in Gopher basketball history, but NCAA basketball history as well.[9] Professional career[edit] Connecticut Sun (2016-2019)[edit] Banham was selected 4th overall by the Connecticut Sun in the 2016 WNBA draft. During her rookie season with the Sun, Banham played in 15 games and averaged 10.9 minutes, 3.7 points, 1 assist, 1 rebound, while shooting 41% from the field and 35% from 3-point distance. Ultimately her rookie year was cut short after she tore her MCL and had micro fracture surgery on July 10.[10] Banham's best year with the Sun came in 2018 when she averaged a career high 5.2 points. During the rest of her time in Connecticut, she did not get much playing time as she only averaged 11.4 minutes, 4 points, 1 assist and 1 rebound a game in her first four seasons with the Sun. Minnesota Lynx (2020-2023)[edit] On February 25, 2020, Banham was acquired by the Minnesota Lynx in a sign and trade deal that sent a 2021 2nd Round Pick to the Sun.[11] During the 2020 Bubble Season in Bradenton, she showed some improvements averaging multiple career highs - 17.4 minutes, 6.9 points, 2.4 assists and 1.3 rebounds a game. She had her best game as a professional against the Indiana Fever on September 12, when she scored a career high 29 points and 10 assists, while making 7 3-pointers. The 2021 season saw a change for Banham as her role decreased as the team signed Kayla McBride, Natalie Achonwa & Aerial Powers during the offseason. On June 29, Banham was waived from the Lynx in order to clear some salary cap space for Minnesota.[12] After clearing waivers, the Lynx re-signed Banham to a rest of season deal on July 5 - allowing her to re-join the team.[13] Connecticut Sun (2024)[edit] Banham returned to the Sun in February 2024, signing a two year deal with the team.[14] Banham set an WNBA record with 8 three pointers off the bench on July 14, 2024.[15] Chicago Sky (2024-present)[edit] On July 17, 2024, Banham was traded to the Chicago Sky alongside Moriah Jefferson, a 2025 1st round pick and the rights to swap 2026 first round picks, in exchange for Marina Mabrey and a 2025 2nd round pick from the Chicago Sky.[16] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 regular season WNBA regular season statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2016 Connecticut 15 0 10.9 .408 .351 .667 0.7 0.9 0.5 0.1 0.5 3.7 2017 Connecticut 30 0 9.4 .327 .281 .800 1.1 0.7 0.1 0.0 0.4 3.3 2018 Connecticut 33 5 12.8 .414 .370 .868 0.9 1.5 0.5 0.1 0.5 5.2 2019 Connecticut 29 0 12.2 .322 .306 .692 1.0 0.9 0.3 0.1 0.9 3.6 2020 Minnesota 20 1 17.0 .462 .472 .800 1.3 2.4 0.5 0.1 1.0 6.9 2021 Minnesota 27 0 12.6 .395 .373 .625 1.2 1.6 0.3 0.1 0.9 5.0 2022 Minnesota 36 5 17.5 .430 .383 .800 1.3 2.3 0.3 0.1 1.3 7.9 2023 Minnesota 32 1 13.6 .370 .402 .786 1.0 1.7 0.3 0.1 1.1 5.5 2024 Connecticut 21 0 12.9 .358 .348 .900 1.2 0.7 0.4 0.2 0.5 4.8 Chicago 16 9 19.8 .346 .382 .700 1.8 1.6 0.4 0.1 0.6 6.9 Career 8 years, 3 teams 259 21 13.7 .387 .370 .795 1.1 1.5 0.3 0.1 0.8 5.3 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2017 Connecticut 1 0 2.0 1.000 1.000 .000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 2018 Connecticut 1 0 9.0 .250 1.000 .000 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 2019 Connecticut 4 0 6.0 .375 .600 1.000 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.3 2.8 2020 Minnesota 4 0 18.8 .310 .333 1.000 1.5 1.8 0.0 0.3 1.3 5.8 2021 Minnesota 1 0 5.0 .000 .000 1.000 1.0 0.9 0.1 0.3 0.7 2.0 2023 Minnesota 3 0 19.7 .316 .231 .000 1.7 3.0 1.0 0.7 1.7 5.0 Career 6 years, 2 teams 14 0 12.4 .317 .375 1.000 1.1 1.4 0.3 0.4 0.9 4.1 College[edit] NCAA statistics[17] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2011-12 Minnesota 36 36 33.7 .419 .425 .817 5.2 2.7 1.6 0.2 3.2 16.1 2012-13 Minnesota 32 32 35.3 .435 .335 .895 4.0 3.9 1.9 0.4 2.8 20.7 2013-14 Minnesota 34 34 35.7 .418 .421 .874 3.7 3.9 1.3 0.3 2.6 22.1 2014-15 Minnesota 10 10 28.5 .426 .405 .737 4.5 4.6 1.0 0.8 2.3 18.6 2015-16 Minnesota 32 32 33.8 .457 .390 .859 5.9 3.8 2.0 0.3 3.2 28.6 Career 144 144 34.2 .433 .394 .857 4.7 3.6 1.7 0.3 2.9 21.5 Personal life[edit] It was also announced on January 2, 2022, on social media that she and her boyfriend Andre Hollins were engaged at Williams Arena.[18] See also[edit] List of NCAA Division I women's basketball career scoring leaders List of NCAA Division I women's basketball season scoring leaders References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Rachel Banham.

She played college basketball at Syracuse and South Carolina. She won two national championships with South Carolina in 2022 and 2024, and was named NCAA Tournament MOP in 2024. Cardoso was selected third overall in the 2024 WNBA draft by the Chicago Sky. Early life[edit] A native of Montes Claros, Brazil, Cardoso played high school basketball for Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tennessee. As a senior, she averaged 24.1 points, 15.8 rebounds and 9.2 blocks per game. Cardoso was selected to play in the McDonald's All-American Game and the Jordan Brand Classic.[1] Rated a five-star recruit and the number five player in her class by ESPN, she committed to playing college basketball for Syracuse over offers from UConn, Ohio State, Mississippi State and South Carolina.[2] She was the highest-rated recruit in program history.[3] College career[edit] As a freshman at Syracuse, Cardoso was the team's starting center and averaged 13.6 points, eight rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game, becoming the first player in program history to win the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Freshman of the Year award.[3] She shared ACC Defensive Player of the Year honors from the league's coaches with Lorela Cubaj and was named first-team All-ACC by the Blue Ribbon Panel.[4] Following the season, Cardoso transferred to South Carolina.[3] As a sophomore, she was a reserve for Aliyah Boston, averaging 5.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game and helping her team win the national championship.[5] In her junior season, Cardoso averaged 9.8 points and 8.5 rebounds per game off the bench. She was named Southeastern Conference (SEC) Sixth Woman of the Year and second-team All-SEC.[6] On 7 April 2024, Cardoso was named the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player following a dominant 15-point, 17-rebound performance in her team's 2024 national championship win.[7] Cardoso graduated shortly after the 2024 WNBA draft, having majored in psychology.[8] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] Chicago Sky (2024-present)[edit] Cardoso was selected 3rd overall in the 2024 WNBA draft by the Chicago Sky.[9] In her first pre-season game against the Minnesota Lynx, Cardoso suffered a shoulder injury that caused her to miss the first six games of the 2024 WNBA season.[10] She made her debut on 1 June, posting 11 points and 6 rebounds off the bench in 18 minutes in a 70-71 loss to the Indiana Fever.[11] After the Sky starting center Elizabeth Williams suffered a season-ending knee injury, Cardoso was slotted into the starting lineup. On 8 June, she made her debut as a starter and recorded 13 points and 5 rebounds in 21 minutes in a 71-80 loss to the Atlanta Dream. Cardoso's season ended prematurely as she re-aggravated her shoulder injury and did not play in the last two games.[12] In her rookie season, Cardoso averaged 9.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks, and ranked second in the league (behind teammate Angel Reese) in offensive rebounds per game at 3.0. After the season, she was named to the WNBA All-Rookie Team.[13] In 2025, It was announced that Cardoso would be leaving the Sky temporarily to join Brazil for the 2025 FIBA AmeriCup.[14] Overseas[edit] Cardoso signed with the Shanghai Swordfish of the Women's Chinese Basketball Association for the 2024-2025 season. She was awarded the International Player of the Year for the 2025 season.[15] National team career[edit] Cardoso represented Brazil at the 2021 FIBA Women's AmeriCup in Puerto Rico. She averaged 9.9 points and eight rebounds per game, helping her team win the bronze medal.[16] Cardoso won a gold medal and earned MVP honors at the 2022 South American Basketball Championship in Argentina. She averaged 14.8 points, 11.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game in the tournament.[17] Cardoso led Brazil to a gold medal at the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup in Mexico, where she was named tournament MVP and averaged 10.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. She recorded 20 points and 11 rebounds in a 69-58 win against the United States in the final.[18] Cardoso rejoined the national team as they sought a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympics through a qualifying tournament held in the Brazilian city of Belém. During the decisive game against Germany, Cardoso was fouled out after an altercation with Satou Sabally, leading to four free throws that led to a German win and Brazil's elimination.[19] She was still chosen for the tournament's all-star team, with averages of 15.3 points and 11 rebounds.[20] Cardoso was a silver medalist at the 2025 FIBA Women's AmeriCup, where fouls reduced her play time in the final against the United States to just 18 minutes, and was chosen to the all-star team, having led the tournament in efficiency, field goal percentage, rebounds, and blocks, and ranking fifth in points per game with 14.9.[21] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader * Denotes season(s) in which Cardoso won an NCAA Championship WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 regular season WNBA regular season statistics[22] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2024 Chicago 32 29 27.4 .521 -- .726 7.9 1.7 0.5 1.4 1.5 9.8 Career 1 year, 1 team 32 29 27.4 .521 -- .726 7.9 1.7 0.5 1.4 1.5 9.8 College[edit] NCAA statistics[23] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2020-21 Syracuse 24 23 23.5 .576 .000 .602 8.0 0.7 0.6 2.7 1.8 13.6 2021-22* South Carolina 32 0 13.3 .553 -- .717 5.1 1.0 0.3 1.4 1.2 5.4 2022-23 South Carolina 36 0 18.8 .559 -- .694 8.5 0.9 0.4 1.9 1.1 9.8 2023-24* South Carolina 33 32 25.3 .594 1.000 .659 9.7 2.0 0.6 2.5 1.5 14.4 Career 125 55 20.0 .575 .500 .662 7.9 1.2 0.5 2.1 1.4 10.6 Off the court[edit] In popular culture[edit] In March 2024, ESPN+ announced their new original docuseries, Full Court Press would premiere in May 2024.[24] The series (from Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions and Words & Pictures) followed Cardoso, Iowa's Caitlin Clark, and UCLA's Kiki Rice throughout their 2023-24 season and postseason.[24][25] References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Kamilla Cardoso.

She is also a basketball analyst featured on TSN. Nurse has played for the Canada Women's National Basketball team. She was selected to play in the 2020 Summer Olympics.[1] Early life[edit] Kia Nurse began playing basketball at the age of four, and by the time she was seven years old, she was playing in a competitive league. Nurse attended St. Vincent de Paul Elementary School. Nurse played basketball while attending St. Thomas More Catholic Secondary School in Hamilton, Ontario. During her playing career, she helped the team win three consecutive OFSAA high school championships in 2011, 2012 and 2013. She played for the Hamilton Transway Club team, winning seven consecutive provincial championships. College career[edit] Nurse played college basketball at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut for the Huskies.[2] In her time at UConn, Nurse played under head coach Geno Auriemma, alongside players such as Breanna Stewart, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Approximately 50 colleges and universities contacted Nurse to ask her to consider playing for their team.[citation needed] She initially narrowed down the list to four teams, Connecticut, Penn State, Indiana, and Kentucky, but eventually chose Connecticut. After signing her letter of intent, she revealed that she had recorded a goal of playing for Connecticut when she was in Grade 7.[3] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] At the 2018 WNBA draft, Nurse was drafted by the New York Liberty in the first round as the tenth overall pick.[4] Nurse would join the Liberty alongside players such as Tina Charles and Epiphanny Prince. Nurse made her WNBA debut on May 20, 2018, scoring 17 points in an eventual 80-76 loss to the Chicago Sky.[5] In June 2018, Nurse scored 34 points, a season-high amongst WNBA rookies, in the Liberty's 87-81 overtime victory over the Indiana Fever.[6] In July 2019, Nurse was named as a starter for the WNBA All-Star Game for the first time in her career.[7] Her selection made her just the third Canadian to play in the All-Star Game. Nurse was selected by and joined Team Delle Donne for the game. Nurse also participated in the Three-Point Contest but lost in the first round. Nurse was traded to the Phoenix Mercury along with Megan Walker by the Liberty for the 2021 season in exchange for the Mercury's 2021 and 2022 1st round picks.[8] Nurse tore her ACL in Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals against the Aces. This would cause her to miss the remaining postseason games.[9] The Mercury would go on to lose in the finals against the Chicago Sky. On February 5, 2022, the Mercury announced that they had re-signed Nurse for the 2022 season.[10] Nurse's injury would cause her to miss the entire 2022 season.[11] On January 31, 2024, Nurse was traded by the Seattle Storm to the Los Angeles Sparks alongside the 2024 WNBA draft 1st round pick (4th overall) in exchange for the Sparks' 2026 1st round pick.[12] On February 4, 2025, Nurse signed with the Chicago Sky.[13] National team career[edit] Youth level[edit] Nurse was invited to play on the under-17 national team in the FIBA Under-17 World Championship for Women, held in Amsterdam in 2012. She averaged almost 14 points per game and helped the team finish third place.[14][15] Senior level[edit] Nurse was invited to join the national team, to play in the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship for Women, held in Xalapa, Mexico from September 21-28. She averaged ten points per game and helped the Canadian National team to a second place, silver medal finish. Canada faced Cuba in a preliminary round and won 53-40, but in the championship game, Cuba prevailed 79-71.[16][17][18][19] Nurse played on the Canadian national team in the 2014 FIBA World Championship. The team lost to Australia in the quarterfinals, then beat France and China to finish in fifth place.[20] Nurse averaged almost 22 minutes per game at the point guard position, averaging almost seven points per game, fourth most on the roster while being the team's youngest player.[21] Nurse was a member of the Canada women's national basketball team, which participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario from July 10-26. Canada opened the preliminary rounds with an easy 101-38 win over Venezuela. The following day they beat Argentina 73-58. The final preliminary game was against Cuba; both teams were 2-0, so the winner would win the group. The game went down to the wire, with Canada eking out a 71-68 win.[22] Canada defeated Brazil in the semifinal, 91-63.[23] In front of a home crowd, the Canadians were able to take down the United States 81-73 and take home the gold medal. It was Canada's first gold medal in basketball in the Pan Am games. Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts and 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts, including two of three three-pointers.[24][25][26][27] Her performance led to her selection as the flag-bearer in the event's closing ceremonies.[28] Nurse played for Canada at the 2015 FIBA Americas Women's Championship, a qualifying event held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in August 2015. Canada won the first three games, easily winning first place in the group for a spot in the semifinal against the second-place team in group B, Brazil. The semifinal game against Brazil was much closer. Canada led by only six points at halftime but gradually expanded the lead to end up with an 83-66 win and a spot in the gold-medal game.[29] The gold-medal game was a rematch with Cuba where Canada took home the win, 82-66. As the game wound down to the close, the crowd was chanting ""Rio"", ""Rio"", ""Rio"" in recognition of the fact that the win qualifies Canada for the Olympics in Rio in 2016. Nurse was the leading scorer for Canada with 20 points, and her overall performance earned her the MVP award for the entire event.[30][31] In 2016, Nurse made her Olympic debut for Team Canada at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.[32] Canada finished in seventh place. Nurse was announced as a member of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic squad on June 29, 2021.[33] Canada would go on to finish in 9th place overall.[34] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader * Denotes season(s) in which Nurse won an NCAA Championship WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[35] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2018 New York 34 7 22.8 .402 .294 .870 2.4 1.6 0.7 0.1 0.9 9.1 2019 New York 34 34 29.4 .393 .353 .872 2.5 2.3 0.7 0.1 1.6 13.7 2020 New York 21 18 27.5 .273 .238 .864 2.9 2.3 0.5 0.2 2.2 12.2 2021 Phoenix 32 32 26.1 .359 .353 .790 3.5 1.8 0.5 0.1 1.5 9.5 2022 Did not play (injury) 2023 Seattle 40 40 19.7 .343 .350 .889 2.3 1.3 0.6 0.1 0.7 5.9 2024 Los Angeles 40 27 20.3 .388 .331 .793 1.6 1.3 0.5 0.0 1.2 7.6 Career 6 years, 4 teams 201 138 23.8 .363 .324 .850 2.5 1.7 0.6 0.1 1.3 9.3 All-Star 1 1 17.3 .500 .375 -- 2.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 15.0 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2021 Phoenix 6 6 21.8 .432 .455 1.000 3.3 1.5 0.2 0.0 0.7 8.3 Career 1 year, 1 team 6 6 21.8 .432 .455 1.000 3.3 1.5 0.2 0.0 0.7 8.3 College[edit] NCAA statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2014-15* Connecticut 39 36 25.0 .485 .407 .721 3.1 2.7 1.4 0.1 1.5 10.2 2015-16* Connecticut 38 38 28.3 .442 .369 .753 1.9 2.7 1.3 0.1 1.3 9.3 2016-17 Connecticut 33 33 30.6 .480 .462 .855 2.0 3.8 1.0 0.1 1.5 12.7 2017-18 Connecticut 33 33 33.1 .519 .442 .809 3.5 2.7 1.2 0.3 1.2 13.5 Career 147 144 30.6 .483 .423 .784 2.6 3.0 1.2 0.1 1.4 11.4 Personal life[edit] Kia Nurse was born to Richard and Cathy Nurse and was raised in Hamilton, Ontario.

She played college basketball with the UCLA Bruins of the Pac-12 Conference. Early life and college[edit] In high school, Onyenwere was named a McDonald's All-American in 2017.[1] Following the 2017-18 season, Onyenwere was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team.[1] In the 2018-19 season, Onyenwere's sophomore season, she was named to the All-Pac-12 team and to the Media All-Pac-12 team, and she ranked second in the Pac-12 for offensive rebounds per game. After that season, she earned on a spot on the 2019 U.S. Pan-American Games Women's Basketball Team.[1] In the 2019-20 season, Onyenwere was again named to the All-Pac-12 team, along with her teammate Japreece Dean.[2] She was named AP and USBWA Third-Team All-American.[1] In the 2020-21 season, Onyenwere was named to the All-Pac-12 team for the third year in a row, and once again named AP and USBWA Third-Team All-American. She was also named Top 5 Finalist of the Cheryl Miller Award. Onyenwere finished her college career fourth on UCLA's all-time scoring list with 1,888-career points.[1] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] New York Liberty (2021-2022)[edit] Onyenwere with the New York Liberty in 2022 Onyenwere was drafted 6th overall in the 2021 WNBA draft by the New York Liberty .[3] In her rookie season in 2021, Onyenwere was named in the 2021 WNBA All-Rookie Team and 2021 WNBA Rookie of the Year. She became the first player in franchise history to win the award.[4] Onyenwere was the leading candidate for most of the season, winning every Rookie of the Month award to become just the fifth player in WNBA history to sweep that honor during a season, and fell just two votes shy of winning unanimously. Onyenwere started in 29 of 32 games and was the most productive player in the class by some margin. She averaged 8.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game, leading all rookies in scoring and 3-pointers made (37).[5] Onyenwere's role diminished in her second season with the Liberty under new head coach Sandy Brondello. Onyenwere was moved to the bench and started only one game all season. She also struggled with nagging injuries since the start of the training camp, which contributed to her minutes decreasing from an average of 22.2 minutes in 2021 to 13.7 minutes in 2022. With the Liberty acquiring star frontcourt players such as Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones before the 2023 season, Onyenwere's roster spot was in question and she was consequently traded.[6][7] Phoenix Mercury (2023)[edit] On February 11, 2023, Onyenwere was traded to the Phoenix Mercury in a four-team trade involving the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury, Dallas Wings, and Chicago Sky.[8] She started 27 of 40 games and set career highs in every category, but it was a disappointing season for the Mercury, who finished 12th in the league with a 9-31 record.[9] Chicago Sky (2024-present)[edit] On February 6, 2024, Onyenwere was traded to the Chicago Sky alongside Brianna Turner, the 2024 No. 3 pick, a 2025 second round pick (from CHI), a 2026 first round pick, and the right to swap 2026 second round in exchange for Kahleah Copper and the rights to Morgan Bertsch.[10] Onyenwere saw limited playing time in the first half of the 2024 season, but earned a place in the starting lineup after the Olympic break, replacing Marina Mabrey, who was traded to the Connecticut Sun.[11][12] Onyenwere re-signed with the Sky for the 2025 season.[13] Overseas[edit] In December 2021, Onyenwere joined the Catalan team Uni Girona CB of the Spanish Liga Femenina de Baloncesto.[14][15] In December 2022, Onyenwere joined the Spanish team CB Avenida.[16] In the 2023-2024 offseason, she played in OGM Ormanspor of the Turkish Women's Basketball Super League.[17] In February 2025, Onyenwere joined the Jiangsu Phoenix of the Women's Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA).[18] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 regular season WNBA regular season statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2021 New York 32 29 22.2 .401 .327 .836 2.9 0.6 0.4 0.3 1.1 8.6 2022 New York 34 1 13.7 .377 .300 .836 2.1 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.7 4.7 2023 Phoenix 40 27 23.8 .404 .315 .759 3.7 1.3 0.8 0.5 2.0 8.9 2024 Chicago 34 18 18.7 .415 .368 .610 1.8 1.0 0.6 0.4 1.3 6.6 Career 4 years, 3 teams 140 75 19.8 .402 .327 .773 2.7 0.8 0.6 0.3 1.3 7.3 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2021 New York 1 0 9.0 .000 -- -- 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2022 New York 3 0 7.3 .364 .000 1.000 1.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.7 Career 2 years, 1 team 4 0 7.8 .333 .000 1.000 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.5 College[edit] NCAA statistics[19] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2017-18 UCLA 35 1 17.1 47.2 16.7 82.2 4.7 0.5 1.1 0.4 0.7 6.9 2018-19 UCLA 35 35 31.9 47.4 33.9 83.2 8.5 1.1 1.1 0.9 1.9 18.3 2019-20 UCLA 30 30 30.3 46.6 25.7 79.3 8.5 1.5 1.5 0.7 2.0 18.9 2020-21 UCLA 23 23 31.3 42.1 33.3 80.0 7.2 2.0 1.1 0.4 2.5 19.1 Career 123 89 27.2 45.9 30.4 81.0 7.2 1.2 1.2 0.6 1.7 15.3 References[edit] External links[edit] Career statistics from WNBA.com · Basketball Reference Media related to Michaela Onyenwere at Wikimedia Commons Retrieved from ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michaela_Onyenwere&oldid=1297479557"""

Nicknamed ""Bayou Barbie"" and ""Chi Barbie"",[1][2] she played college basketball for the Maryland Terrapins and LSU Tigers. Reese attended Saint Frances Academy in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was awarded McDonald's All-American honors in 2020 and was ranked the number two player in her class by ESPN. She joined the Maryland Terrapins as the highest-ranked recruit in program history, but her freshman season in 2020-21 was interrupted by a fractured right foot. She was named a third-team All-American by the Associated Press as a sophomore. In her junior season, Reese transferred to LSU and was a unanimous first-team All-American selection. She led LSU to its first national championship, where she was Most Outstanding Player. Reese set the NCAA single-season record in double-doubles and the SEC single-season record in rebounds. As a senior, she was named SEC Player of the Year and an All-American. Reese was selected by the Chicago Sky with the seventh overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft. In her rookie season, she was named an WNBA All-Star and set the league single-season record in rebounds. At the international level, she helped the United States win a silver medal at the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup. In 2025, she appeared on the cover of Vogue. Early life Angel Reese was born on May 6, 2002, in Randallstown, Maryland, to Angel and Michael Reese.[3][4] She learned how to play basketball from her mother at a very young age and grew up playing against her brother, Julian, in their driveway. Reese competed in a recreational league in Baltimore County, where her mother also played. She emerged as one of the best players in the city and had success playing above her age group and on boys' teams.[5] Reese played the point guard position before having two growth spurts by her first year of high school. In addition to basketball, she took part in ballet, gymnastics, swimming and track during her childhood.[5][6] Reese often attended Washington Mystics games and drew inspiration from Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) players Candace Parker and Maya Moore, as well as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player and Baltimore native Muggsy Bogues.[7][8] She was coached by Ron James with Team Takeover, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program based in Washington, D.C. that competes in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL), a national circuit.[9] Her AAU teammates included Madison Scott, Mir McLean and Jakia Brown-Turner,[10][11] all of whom were given five-star ratings by ESPN at the end of their high school careers.[12][13][14] High school Reese attended St. Frances Academy in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was a four-year varsity basketball player under head coach Jerome Shelton.[3][15] Early in her career, she was teammates with future WNBA player Nia Clouden.[16][17] Due to her size and athleticism, she could play all five positions and entered the starting lineup midway through her first season.[18] As a freshman, Reese averaged 11.1 points and 11 rebounds per game, earning All-Metro first team honors from The Baltimore Sun.[19] She helped her team win the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland (IAAM) A Conference title and finish the season with a 30-1 record.[20] Her team suffered its only loss to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy at the High School Nationals semifinals, where Reese recorded 20 points and 24 rebounds and made a putback shot to beat the buzzer and send the game to overtime.[21] She was named to the High School Nationals all-tournament team.[22] In her sophomore season, Reese repeated as an All-Metro first team selection, helping St. Frances win the IAAM A Conference championship and achieve a 24-4 record. She averaged 17.6 points, 12.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.8 blocks per game, leading her team in all four categories.[23][24] Following the season, Reese played in the Capital Classic and was named her team's most valuable player after guiding the United States Future Stars to a 115-80 win over the Capital All-Stars.[25] She was suspended early in her junior season after punching an opposing player in the face during a preseason scrimmage; no charges were filed.[17][26] Reese averaged 22.6 points and 19.3 rebounds per game as a junior and was named All-Metro Player of the Year by The Baltimore Sun after leading St. Frances to the IAAM A Conference title.[27] That year, she led Team Takeover to the Nike EYBL championship, posting 18 points and 11 rebounds in a 57-47 win over All Iowa Attack in the final.[28] In January 2020, Archbishop Spalding High School head coach Lisa Smith was fired from her position after her private messages on Instagram criticizing Reese's behavior were made public. Reese's mother felt that the messages included racial overtones by attributing Reese's success to being genetically gifted.[26] On January 31, Reese's number 10 jersey was retired by St. Frances, and she became the first female player to receive the honor.[16] As a senior, she averaged 18.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, winning her fourth straight IAAM A Conference championship and helping her team finish with a 25-3 record.[29] Reese was selected to play at the McDonald's All-American Game and the Jordan Brand Classic, two major high school all-star games, but both were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[29] She repeated as All-Metro Player of the Year and was also named High School Female Athlete of the Year by The Baltimore Sun. Reese finished her career with 1,720 points, second in St. Frances history to Melba Chambers, and 1,250 rebounds.[18][29] In addition to basketball, Reese was a member of the volleyball team at St. Frances, playing the outside hitter position.[30] In her freshman season, she helped the team win the IAAM C Conference championship, the school's first IAAM title in a sport other than basketball.[31] Reese led St. Frances to another IAAM C Conference title as a sophomore.[30] Recruiting Reese was considered a five-star recruit, the number two player and the top wing in the 2020 class by ESPN.[6][32] By her junior season of high school, she held scholarship offers from over 24 NCAA Division I basketball programs, including Maryland, South Carolina and Louisville.[33] On November 1, 2019, she announced her commitment to Maryland, becoming the highest-ranked recruit in program history. Her other finalists were South Carolina, USC, Syracuse and Tennessee.[16][34] On November 13, Reese signed a National Letter of Intent with the program.[35] She was drawn to Maryland because of its proximity to her home, head coach Brenda Frese, who had recruited her since eighth grade, and assistant coach Shay Robinson. She preferred to play with a post player in Shakira Austin, who instead transferred from the program before Reese's first season.[34][36] She was also attracted to Maryland by its strong academics and the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.[6] College career Freshman season Reese entered her freshman season in the starting lineup for Maryland, primarily as a power forward.[37][38] Despite being a freshman, she was praised by head coach Brenda Frese for her leadership.[39] Frese viewed Reese as part of the team's Big Three that also included Ashley Owusu and Diamond Miller.[38] On November 27, 2020, she made her debut for Maryland, recording a season-high 20 points and nine rebounds in a 94-72 win over Davidson at the Gulf Coast Challenge.[40] In her fourth game, on December 3 against Towson, she suffered a Jones fracture in her right foot after landing awkwardly during the opening minutes.[41] She underwent surgery and was sidelined until February 23, 2021.[42][43] Reese came off the bench following her return from injury.[37] She helped Maryland win Big Ten regular season and tournament titles.[44] At the end of the regular season, she was named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team.[45] On March 24, 2021, in the second round of the NCAA tournament, Reese scored 19 points to help second-seeded Maryland defeat seventh-seeded Alabama, 100-64.[46] In the Sweet 16, her team was upset by sixth-seeded Texas, 64-61.[47] As a freshman, Reese averaged ten points and six rebounds per game. Following the season, she won a silver medal with the Maryland 3x3 team at the USA Basketball 3X Nationals.[48] Sophomore season Reese with Maryland in 2022 Reese returned to a starting role in her sophomore season.[49] She described the season as a ""redemption year"" and regained confidence from before her injury as a freshman.[50] In her season debut on November 9, Reese recorded 21 points and 14 rebounds in a 97-67 win against Longwood.[51] On December 2, 2021, Reese had a season-high 26 points and 15 rebounds in an 82-74 win against Miami (Florida) in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge.[52] On February 14, 2022, she posted 25 points and 13 rebounds in an 81-69 victory over Iowa.[53] Reese was named first-team All-Big Ten and made the conference's All-Defensive Team.[54] She led fourth-seeded Maryland to the Sweet 16 of the 2022 NCAA tournament, where she recorded 25 points, 9 rebounds, 3 steals and 3 blocks in a 72-66 loss to first-seeded Stanford on March 25.[55] Reese received third-team All-American honors from the AP and made the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) and Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) All-American honorable mention.[56][57][58] As a sophomore, she averaged 17.8 points and 10.6 rebounds per game, becoming the first Maryland player to average a double-double since Angie Scott in 1975.[59] On April 5, 2022, Reese entered the transfer portal with several of her teammates.[60] She later explained that she wanted a fresh start and a coach who would develop her into a stretch four to prepare her for the WNBA.[36] She was the most heralded transfer in the nation and took visits to Louisiana State University (LSU), South Carolina and Tennessee.[61][62] She took interest in LSU after Ohio State transfer Kateri Poole, whom she had known since high school, suggested that they visit the school together.[36] Junior season On May 6, 2022, LSU announced that Reese would transfer to their program.[63][64] She made the decision due to her trust in head coach Kim Mulkey and a desire to join a ""winning culture"".[63] Reese was also impressed by the school's interest in the women's team.[36] On November 7, she made her debut for LSU, recording 31 points and 13 rebounds in a 125-50 win over Bellarmine.[65] Reese posted 32 points and 15 rebounds in an 88-42 victory over Lamar on December 14.[66] She surpassed LSU's single-game rebounding record, held by Maree Jackson since 1977, during a 26-point, 28-rebound performance in a 74-34 win over Texas A&M on January 5, 2023.[67] Reese had her 20th straight double-double on January 23, with 14 points and 14 rebounds in an 89-51 win against Alabama. She broke the program record for consecutive double-doubles, set by Sylvia Fowles during the 2006-07 season.[68] On February 16, Reese had a career-high 36 points and 20 rebounds in a 69-60 win over Ole Miss.[69] She earned first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) and All-Defensive Team honors at the end of the regular season.[70] In the first round of the 2023 NCAA tournament, she recorded 34 points and 15 rebounds in a 73-50 win against Hawaii.[71] Reese posted 25 points, 24 rebounds and 6 blocks in a 66-42 second-round win over Michigan.[72] In the Elite Eight, she registered her 32nd double-double, breaking the SEC single-season record held by Teaira McCowan of Mississippi State. Reese was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Greenville Regional 2.[73][74] In the Final Four, she set the program and SEC single-season rebounding records after posting 24 points and 12 rebounds in a 79-72 win over Virginia Tech.[75] Reese with President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden during her team's visit to the White House in 2023 Reese helped LSU win its first national championship, posting 15 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a 102-85 victory over Iowa in the title game. She won the tournament Most Outstanding Player award and set the NCAA single-season record with 34 double-doubles.[76] In the closing minutes of the game, Reese followed Iowa star Caitlin Clark around the court and made a ""you can't see me"" gesture by waving her hand in front of her face--a taunt popularized by professional wrestler John Cena--before pointing to her ring finger in reference to a championship ring. Her actions came under scrutiny, with some journalists and analysts criticizing her for poor sportsmanship and others, including Reese herself, pointing to a double standard, because Clark had not received similar backlash for making the ""you can't see me"" gesture two games earlier.[77] Clark later defended Reese from criticism over the gesture.[78] The incident drew attention to the roles of race and gender in the perception of trash talk in sports since Reese is Black and Clark is white.[79][80][81] It has also been described as the origin of a rivalry between Reese and Clark.[82] Following the game, First Lady Jill Biden remarked that she wanted Iowa to be invited to the White House along with LSU, as an addition to the custom of the president and first lady hosting the national champions.

Her father built a sports court with a basketball goal behind the family house, but she almost never played there, choosing instead to play at a hoop in front of a neighbor's house where she could easily be seen by other children in the neighborhood. She regularly played against boys.[1] During the third grade, she wrote a school paper about her dreams of one day playing in the WNBA.[9] While Vandersloot regularly played basketball and many other sports as a child--she was also on a fast-pitch softball team that was runner-up in a Washington state tournament at age 11-- her favorite sport was soccer; she had a poster of Mia Hamm on her bedroom wall.[9] She did not concentrate on basketball until high school: I grew up wanting to go to North Carolina because of Mia Hamm. Once I got into high school and basketball started interfering with club soccer I found I dreaded going to soccer practice. I was having so much fun developing my game. I just fell in love with it.[1] High school[edit] Vandersloot became a basketball star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6 inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either before or after the team's practice. He would later say, ""I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' "" She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.[9] A pivotal moment in her life came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the Gonzaga University girls' basketball camp. She would say about the trip in 2011, ""I just fell in love with this place. I felt so comfortable here."" The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves, who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.[1] That season, she had averaged more than 18 points and 7 assists as she led Kentwood to its first state tournament appearance; they would lose in the second round of the tournament to Spokane's University High, led by future Tennessee star Angie Bjorklund. After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider Washington or another Pac-10 school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small.[1] She would eventually sign with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, ""I wasn't really being highly recruited and I just didn't want to go through the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga.""[9] Vandersloot took her game to another level as a senior, averaging 26 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals while leading Kentwood to a third-place finish in the state tournament; their only loss was in the state semifinals. She scored 113 points in the tournament, one shy of the state record for a girls' tournament, and was named MVP. Vandersloot was also consensus first-team all-state, and was named the state's player of the year by the Seattle Times.[10] Vandersloot was rated as the No. 64 national prospect,[11] and No. 35 among guards,[12] by Scout.com. College career[edit] By her own admission, Vandersloot came to Gonzaga as a shy freshman. During that first season, Graves suggested that she call the school's greatest point guard in history for advice--Hall of Famer John Stockton. Vandersloot would recall that it ""took me a couple of weeks to build up,""[1] and when she finally called Stockton for the first time, she hoped that she would reach his voice mail so she wouldn't have to talk.[13] Vandersloot eventually worked with Stockton throughout her Gonzaga career.[1] As a freshman in 2007-08, she was the West Coast Conference newcomer of the year and named to the 10-member All-WCC first team after averaging 10.3 points, 5.7 assists, and 1.9 steals per game entering the WCC tournament, finishing in the top five in the WCC in the latter two categories while the Zags went 13-1 in conference play and earned the tournament's top seed.[14] However, the Bulldogs lost in the WCC final to San Diego[15] and ultimately missed out on the NCAA Tournament, playing instead in the WNIT. They defeated UC Davis in the first round[16] before falling to Colorado in the second round.[17] In her 2008-09 sophomore season, she set a school record in assists with 239;[1] at the end of the regular season, her average of 7.3 per game led the conference, and she was also third in the conference in scoring at 16.4 per game.[18] Vandersloot won the first of what would be three WCC Player of the Year awards.[18] The Bulldogs went on to win the WCC tournament, with Vandersloot named tournament MVP.[19] In the NCAA tournament, the Zags defeated Xavier for the program's first NCAA Tournament win[20] before narrowly losing in the second round to Pitt.[21] As a junior in 2009-10, Vandersloot led Division I in assists, averaging 9.4 per game,[22] while leading the Zags to an unbeaten record in conference play.[23] During that season, she broke her own school record for assists in a season with 321,[22] and also broke the Gonzaga and WCC records for career assists.[1] Vandersloot was again named both WCC Player of the Year[23] and WCC Tournament MVP[24] while leading the Bulldogs to a second consecutive WCC Tournament title. In the NCAA tournament, Vandersloot led the Zags one round farther than in 2009, upsetting No. 2 seed (and 2011 champion) Texas A&M before losing in the Sweet Sixteen to the Xavier team they had knocked out the year before.[20] Her senior year at Gonzaga, 2010-11, can be summed up as a season of milestones. She led the WCC in both scoring and assists on the way to a second straight unbeaten season in conference play.[25] Vandersloot was named WCC Player of the Year for an unprecedented[1] third time.[25] The Zags again won the WCC Tournament, and Vandersloot was named tournament MVP for the third straight time,[26] also becoming the first women's player in WCC history to win that honor three times.[1] In the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs were a No. 11 seed, but had the advantage of playing their first-round and potential second-round games at their home court of McCarthey Athletic Center. They would take full advantage of their home court in the first two rounds. The Zags, seeded No. 11 in their region, opened the tournament with a 92-86 upset of Iowa, with Vandersloot scoring a career-high 34 points.[27] In their second-round game against No. 3 seed UCLA, Vandersloot finished with 29 points and 17 assists, one assist shy of the record for a Division I tournament game, as the Zags took down the Bruins 89-75. During that game, she became the first player in Division I history to amass 2,000 career points and 1,000 career assists.[2] The win advanced them to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight year, and to a regional tournament that would be held less than two miles (3.2 km) from the Gonzaga campus at Spokane Arena. During the Bulldogs' next game, a 76-69 win over Louisville, Vandersloot broke the Division I women's record for assists in a season previously held by Suzie McConnell. She finished with 29 points, 7 assists, and 7 steals as the Zags became the lowest-seeded team ever to reach a regional final in the women's tournament.[28] Their tournament run, and Vandersloot's college career, would end one game later as Stanford would defeat the Zags 83-60. While she finished with 25 points, only four came in the second half.[29] In addition to her other milestones during the season, she also broke the Gonzaga single-season scoring record.[30] Vandersloot became one of the most decorated players of the 2010-11 season. She won the women's Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the top Division I player no taller than 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m),[31] and the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top point guard in Division I women's basketball.[30] She was also named to multiple All-America teams. The AP named her a second-team All-America; she became the first women's player in WCC history to be named to that specific team.[32] She also was named to the five-woman Wooden All-America Team, another honor never before achieved by a WCC player.[33] Finally, she was named to the 10-player USBWA All-America team, becoming the first Gonzaga player so honored,[34] and the 10-member State Farm Coaches All-America team, another first for a WCC player.[35] Her impact on the Gonzaga program can be measured by another statistic--home attendance. The year before she arrived in Spokane, the Bulldogs averaged 1,492 with a team that would make its first NCAA tournament appearance. By her junior year, attendance had risen to 2,935, and rose again to 3,824 in her senior season, with the Zags selling out the McCarthey Athletic Center twice before the NCAA tournament.[1] On February 11, 2023, Vandersloot had her number retired, becoming the first Gonzaga women's basketball player to receive the honor.[36] College awards and records[edit] Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award (2011) Nancy Lieberman Award (2011) 3× WCC Player of the Year (2009-2011) 3× WCC women's tournament MVP (2009-2011) 4× All-WCC (2008-2011) WCC Newcomer of the Year (2008) 2009 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans (honorable mention, AP) 2010 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans: Honorable mention, AP Honorable mention, State Farm Coaches' 2011 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans: Wooden All-America State Farm Coaches' USBWA Second team, AP No. 21 retired by Gonzaga Bulldogs NCAA records: First NCAA Division I player of either gender with 2,000 points and 1,000 assists Most assists in a season, Division I (367) Professional career[edit] Vandersloot in 2018 WNBA[edit] Vandersloot was widely considered to be one of the top prospects in the 2011 WNBA draft. Her relatively small size had been a subject of concern, as was her defense--despite averaging 4.5 steals per game in the 2011 NCAA tournament and ending her Gonzaga career with 366.[37] However, she was seen as likely to be one of the top seven picks,[38] and was ultimately picked third overall by the Chicago Sky.[3] One indicator of her likely draft position was that Indiana Fever coach Lin Dunn, whose team needed depth at point guard going into the 2011 season, signed Shannon Bobbitt in February, convinced that Vandersloot would be picked before the Fever's turn at #9.[37] John Stockton gave Vandersloot high praise, stating, ""I don't want to dramatize it too much but she's like Gretzky in hockey. There is something that separates Courtney from others.""[1] In her rookie season, she became the Sky's regular starter at the point, ultimately starting 26 of the team's 34 games.[39] Her average of 3.7 assists per game (apg) was 11th in the league[39] and second among rookies.[40] She was also named as an Eastern Conference reserve for the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game,[4] and was one of the five members of the 2011 All-Rookie Team, gaining 10 of a possible 11 votes from the league's head coaches.[5] She became a regular starter for the Sky in subsequent seasons, and helped lead the team to the 2014 WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury in her fourth season, but the Sky were swept 3-0. The 2014 season also marked the first time Vandersloot led the league in assists per game (5.7). In the 2015 season, Vandersloot led the league in total assists (but came in second in assists-per-game to Candace Parker). In the 2017 season, she led the league in assists for the second time in her career, setting the single-season league record for assists per game at 8.1 apg and the record for most assists over a 15-game stretch with 149.[41] However, despite these efforts, the Sky finished 12-22, missing out on the playoffs for the first time in four years. In the 2018 season, Vandersloot broke the single-season record for assists and finished off the season with 258 assists and her own assists per game record with 8.6 apg.[42] On July 20, 2018, Vandersloot became the seventh player in league history to post a triple-double, she scored 13 points along with 10 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists in a 114-99 victory over the Dallas Wings.[43] She also averaged a career-high in scoring. Despite these performances, the Sky missed out on the playoffs yet again, they finished 13-21. Courtney Vandersloot on the Jumbotron at Barclays center during the 2024 WNBA Playoffs In the 2019 season, Vandersloot continued to exceed assists records. She broke her own league record with 9.1 assists per game. She was selected to the 2019 WNBA All-Star Game, making it her second All-Star appearance. Her season performance would help the Sky return to the playoffs with a 20-14 record, earning the number 5 seed. In the first-round elimination game, the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury 105-76 to advance. In the second-round elimination game, the Sky were defeated by the Las Vegas Aces 93-92 after a late game desperation half-court shot by Dearica Hamby. In the 2020 season, the season was shortened to 22 games in a bubble at IMG Academy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vandersloot would average a career-high in scoring and once again set a new record for assists per game with 10, while playing and starting all 22 games. The Sky finished as the number 6 seed with a 12-10 record, but were eliminated by the Connecticut Sun in the first round elimination game. Courtney Vandersloot holds the New York Liberty's 2024 WNBA Championship Trophy during a at a post-win celebration at the Barclay's Center. In the 2021 season, Vandersloot started all 32 games for the Sky and once again led the league with 8.6 assists per game. The Sky finished the season as the sixth seed with a 16-16 record, but went on to a successful run in the playoffs, winning two single-elimination games and a semifinals series against the first-seeded Connecticut Sun to reach the Finals for the first time since 2014. In the 2021 WNBA Finals, Vandersloot recorded 12.5 assists and 11.5 points per game, as the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury in four games to win their first championship. Across the 10 games in the 2021 postseason, she recorded 10.2 assists and 13 points per game. After the 2022 season, Vandersloot became a free agent and signed with the New York Liberty in February 2023.[44] The New York Liberty placed second in the WNBA to the Las Vegas Aces in 2023. In 2024, the Liberty won the WNBA Championship over the Minnesota Lynx. Courtney dedicated the season to her mother, Jan Vandersloot, who died in mid-summer 2024.[45] In 2025, Vandersloot returned to the Sky.[8] On June 8, 2025, it was announced that Vandersloot had sustained a right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear during the June 7 game against the Indiana Fever, would undergo surgery, and would miss the rest of the 2025 season.[46] European leagues[edit] In 2011, she signed with the Turkish club Beşiktaş.[47] Because the WNBA season is held in the northern hemisphere summer, the traditional offseason for basketball throughout the world, many of the league's players participate in overseas leagues during the traditional season and return to their WNBA teams in the summer. In February 2022, after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, she left UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian Women's Basketball Premier League.[48] In April 2022, she joined Hungarian club Sopron Basket for the 2022-23 European season.[49] In January 2023, she signed with Fenerbahçe and left at end of the season. Unrivaled[edit] On September 16, 2024, it was announced that Vandersloot would appear and play in the inaugural season of Unrivaled, a new women's 3-on-3 basketball league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.[50] Personal life[edit] On December 27, 2018, Vandersloot married Chicago Sky teammate, Allie Quigley, in Seattle, near Vandersloot's hometown of Kent, Washington. [51] In May 2025, the couple announced the birth of their first child.[52] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game TO Turnovers per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led Division I degrees Led the league ‡ WNBA record WNBA[edit] † Denotes seasons in which Vandersloot won a WNBA championship Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2025 season WNBA regular season statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2011 Chicago 34 26 22.9 .391 .271 .766 2.0 3.7 0.7 0.3 2.7 6.5 2012 Chicago 34 27 26.7 .405 .333 .649 2.1 4.6 1.2 0.2 3.2 8.9 2013 Chicago 33 33 29.8 .396 .304 .833 3.2 5.6 1.3 0.8 2.4 8.8 2014 Chicago 18 16 25.1 .402 .375 .833 2.2 5.7 degrees 1.1 0.5 2.6 6.8 2015 Chicago 34 34 29.8 .463 .356 .901 3.4 5.8 1.3 0.5 2.0 11.4 2016 Chicago 30 21 24.3 .419 .351 .904 2.7 4.7 1.3 0.1 1.6 9.5 2017 Chicago 27 22 30.3 .516 .382 .861 3.7 8.1 degrees 1.2 0.2 2.9 11.5 2018 Chicago 30 30 31.8 .489 .398 .826 3.7 8.6 degrees 1.3 0.5 3.4 12.5 2019 Chicago 33 33 30.0 .452 .290 .850 4.3 9.1 degrees 1.4 0.5 2.9 11.2 2020 Chicago 22 22 31.5 .491 .395 .889 3.5 10.0‡ 1.2 0.4 2.5 13.6 2021† Chicago 32 32 30.5 .433 .346 .857 3.4 8.6 degrees 1.7 0.4 3.0 10.5 2022 Chicago 32 32 26.5 .481 .367 .765 3.9 6.5 1.2 0.5 2.7 11.8 2023 New York 39 39 30.4 .442 .294 .761 3.5 8.1 degrees 1.3 0.6 2.7 10.5 2024† New York 31 31 22.3 .445 .269 .548 2.6 4.8 0.8 0.5 1.8 6.4 2025 Chicago 7 7 27.3 .439 .217 .846 3.1 5.3 1.6 0.3 2.4 10.6 Career 15 years, 2 teams 436 405 28.0 .446 .335 .813 3.2 6.6 1.2 0.4 2.6 10.0 All-Star 5 1 15.6 .550 .333 - 2.6 5.2 1.0 0.0 1.4 5.0 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoffs statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2013 Chicago 2 2 29.4 .300 .000 1.000 2.0 4.5 1.0 0.5 3.0 7.0 2014 Chicago 9 9 29.8 .383 .133 .850 2.3 6.4 1.3 0.2 2.1 7.3 2015 Chicago 3 3 31.8 .500 .500 1.000 4.7 8.3 0.3 1.0 2.6 13.7 2016 Chicago 5 5 29.7 .431 .333 1.000 2.4 6.4 2.0 0.2 2.6 13.2 2019 Chicago 2 2 30.7 .368 .333 -- 3.0 11.5 degrees 1.0 1.0 3.0 8.0 2020 Chicago 1 1 36.0 .500 .500 -- 4.0 6.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 12.0 2021† Chicago 10 10 34.4 .510 .333 .842 5.4 10.2 1.5 0.8 3.5 13.0 2022 Chicago 8 8 28.3 .481 .261 .800 3.9 5.6 1.1 0.5 2.1 11.5 2023 New York 10 10 32.6 .420 .378 .800 3.9 6.3 1.3 0.7 2.8 10.6 2024† New York 11 0 14.3 .435 .385 .929 2.4 2.5 0.5 0.5 1.0 5.3 Career 10 years, 2 teams 61 50 28.2 .446 .324 .885 3.5 6.4‡ 1.2 0.5 2.4 9.8 College[edit] NCAA statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2007-08 Gonzaga[53] 34 27 28.3 .412 .330 .654 3.9 5.6 1.8 0.2 3.0 10.6 2008-09 Gonzaga[54] 32 31 32.8 .468 .376 .787 4.1 7.5 2.2 0.3 3.8 16.4 2009-10 Gonzaga[55] 34 34 32.6 .472 .346 .746 3.8 9.4* 3.6 0.6 4.3 14.1 2010-11 Gonzaga[56] 36 36 32.9 .486 .378 .831 3.7 10.2* 3.2 0.3 3.3 19.8 Career 136 128 32.9 .463 .358 .769 3.8 8.2 2.7 0.3 3.3 11.8 Notes[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Courtney Vandersloot.

She played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals, LSU Tigers, and TCU Horned Frogs. At Cashmere High School in Cashmere, Washington, Van Lith was rated as one of the top recruits in her class, named a McDonald's All-American and left as the all-time leading scorer in state history. She played her first three college seasons at Louisville, earning first-team All-ACC honors two times and leading the Cardinals to the Final Four as a sophomore in 2022. After her junior season, she transferred to LSU, before moving to TCU for her fifth season. Van Lith was named Big 12 Player of the Year and led TCU to its first Big 12 titles in both the regular season and conference tournament. In the 2025 WNBA draft, Van Lith was drafted by the Chicago Sky with the 11th pick. Van Lith has won two gold medals with the United States at the youth international level. In 3x3 basketball, she has played for the senior national team and is a 2023 FIBA 3x3 World Cup gold medalist and a 2024 Summer Olympics bronze medalist. She was named most valuable player (MVP) of the 2019 FIBA 3x3 Under-18 World Cup, where she led her team to a gold medal. Early life[edit] Van Lith was born in Wenatchee, Washington, to Jessica and Corey Van Lith. Her father played basketball and baseball at the University of Puget Sound, and her parents own a custom home building business.[1][2] She has one brother, Tanner, who played baseball for Big Bend Community College.[1] Van Lith grew up playing basketball under the guidance of her father, who had her train four to five nights per week.[3] She modeled her game after Diana Taurasi and also drew inspiration from Seattle Storm players Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart.[4] Van Lith was a member of the Northwest Blazers Amateur Athletic Union program under coach Steve Klees. She was the first eighth and ninth-grader to play for the Blazers' top team and started in the Adidas Nationals title game in both years, earning Adidas All-American honors.[5] High school career[edit] Van Lith played four years of basketball at Cashmere High School in Cashmere, Washington, under head coach Brent Darnell.[6] On November 30, 2016, she made her debut, scoring 14 points in a win over Ellensburg High School.[7] Van Lith led Cashmere to the Class 1A state title game, where she recorded 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven steals in a 45-44 upset loss to Mount Baker Senior High.

(both scoring and rebounds in double digits).[13] On September 2, 2011, Tina Charles had 10 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds for the first triple-double in Connecticut Sun history, and only the fifth such accomplishment in WNBA history. Charles had eight assists at halftime, and was taken out of the game with nine, because the lead over the opponent was so large. The coach did put her back in the game in the fourth quarter, and she earned an assist on a pass to Jessica Moore, leading to the triple double.[14] However, subsequent review by the league resulted in a change, as three of the assists should not have been credited to Charles, so she ended the game with seven assists, not ten.[15] On August 18, 2012, Charles recorded nine rebounds in an 85-74 win over the Liberty. One of the rebounds in the second quarter pushed her career total to 1,000. She accomplished this milestone faster than any other WNBA player in history. She reached 1,000 rebounds in her 89th game, surpassing the record formerly held by Yolanda Griffith, who reached 1,000 rebounds in her 92nd game.[16] Charles was named the 2012 MVP of the WNBA, winning 25 of 41 first place votes. She led the league in the number of double-doubles recorded, and set the mark for the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 900, 1,000 and 1,100 rebounds.[17] New York Liberty (2014-2019)[edit] In the weeks leading up to the 2014 WNBA draft, rumors had circulated that Charles could be traded before the draft, so the Sun could obtain more draft picks. Just before the Draft, Charles was traded to her native team the New York Liberty in exchange for Kelsey Bone, the fourth overall pick in the 2014 WNBA draft (Alyssa Thomas) and the fourth overall pick in the 2015 WNBA draft (Elizabeth Williams). Charles with the New York Liberty in 2015 In 2016, Charles had the best season of her career, averaging a career-high 21.5 points per game while shooting 43.9% from the field and 81.2% from the free-throw line.[18] Charles had also led the league in rebounds with 9.9 rebounds per game, winning her fourth rebounding title. Her scoring average was tied with Elena Delle Donne but led the league in total points scored which allowed her to claim the scoring title.[19] The Liberty finished with a 21-13 record. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Liberty were the number 3 seed in the league with a bye to the second round with one elimination game to play where they were defeated by the Phoenix Mercury. In 2017, Charles would be voted into the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game making it her fifth career all-star game appearance. On June 2, 2017, Charles scored a career-high 36 points in a 93-89 win over the Dallas Wings.[20] The Liberty would once again finish with number 3 seed in the league, receiving a bye to the second round elimination game. The Liberty would lose yet again in the second round by a final score of 82-69 to the Washington Mystics. In 2018, Charles re-signed with the Liberty.[21] In 2018, Charles would be voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game for her sixth all-star game appearance. The Liberty would miss out on the playoffs for the first time in 4 years as they finished 7-27. On June 4, 2019, Charles became the Liberty's all-time scoring leader after a late-fourth quarter layup in a 78-73 loss to the Los Angeles Sparks. She finished the game with 21 points and 14 rebounds.[22][23] Washington Mystics (2021)[edit] On April 15, 2020, Charles was traded to the Washington Mystics.[24] Charles was medically excused for the shortened 2020 season on July 17, 2020, due to her condition with extrinsic asthma, which impacts her immune system and put her at risk in the coronavirus pandemic.[25] Since 2013, Charles has donated her full WNBA salary to the charity she started, Hopey's Heart Foundation. In 2020, Charles announced she would direct that year's salary to support the Black Lives Matter movement.[26] After two seasons with the Mystics - one sitting out in 2020 - Charles and the Mystics did not re-sign with each other during the 2022 offseason. Phoenix Mercury (2022)[edit] On February 4, 2022, Charles signed with the Phoenix Mercury.[27] Charles joined the Mercury in hopes of winning a title, but the team struggled and wasn't in title contention through the first 18 games of the 2022 season. On June 25, 2022, Charles and the Mercury agreed to a buyout from her contract - officially ending her time in Phoenix.[28] Charles appeared in 16 games for the Mercury and averaged 17.3 points. Seattle Storm (2022)[edit] Charles signed with the Seattle Storm on June 28, 2022.[29] Atlanta Dream (2024)[edit] Charles signed with the Atlanta Dream on February 1, 2024 after not being signed to a team for the 2023 season.[30] Return to Connecticut (2025-present)[edit] On February 2, 2025, Charles signed as a free agent with the Connecticut Sun, returning to the team that drafted her 15 years before.[31][32] Overseas[edit] In the 2011-12 off-season, Charles played in Turkey for Galatasaray. From 2012 to 2014, Charles played two off-seasons in Poland for Wisła Can-Pack Kraków. In the 2014-15 off-season, Charles played in Turkey once again for Fenerbahçe. In the 2015-16 off-season, Charles played in China for the Xinjiang Tianshan Deers.[33] As of November 2016, Charles had signed with the Sichuan Whales for the 2016-17 off-season.[33] In 2017, Charles had re-signed with the Sichuan Whales for the 2017-18 off-season.[34] Charles played for Fenerbahçe in the 2024-2025 season.[35] USA Basketball[edit] Charles was a member of the USA Women's U18 team which won the gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The event was held in July 2006, when the USA team defeated Canada to win the championship. Charles helped set the tone in the opening game against Paraguay, recording a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds. In the gold medal game, she had her second double-double of the tournament with 13 points and 13 rebounds. She was the leading scorer on her team with 12 points per games, as well as the leading rebounder, with 9.5 per game.[36] Charles was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009, one of only three college players invited to the training camp.[37] The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants.[37][38] Charles was named a member of the team representing the US at the 2009 World University Games held in Belgrade, Serbia. The team won all seven games to earn the gold medal. Charles was the team's leading scorer and rebounder, with 16.1 points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game. In the gold medal game against previously undefeated Russia, she had 28 points and 18 rebounds.[39] On October 5, 2009, Charles was selected to be one of the USA National Team members to travel to the 2009 Ekaterinburg International Invitational. She was the only college player on the team.[40] Charles contributed to the USA Basketball win at the Ekaterinburg Tournament. She had double-digit scoring in all three games, with the second game, against Euroleasing Sopron, her best result, scoring 15 points in only 13 minutes of play.[41] Charles was named the USA Basketball 2009 Female Athlete Of The Year, for her contributions to the Gold Medal earned at the 2009 USA Women's World University Games, the Gold Medal earned at the 2009 Ekaterinburg International Invitational, and the undefeated collegiate season leading to a National Championship.[42] Charles was named as one of the National team members to represent the USA Basketball team in the WNBA versus USA Basketball.[43] This game replaces the normal WNBA All-Star game with WNBA All-Stars versus USA Basketball, as part of the preparation for the FIBA World Championship for Women to be held in the Czech Republic during September and October 2010.[44] Charles was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia -- the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83-75. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Charles averaged 10.7 points per game, third best on the team and was the second leading rebounder with 4.8 per game.[45] Charles played for Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[46] Charles would earn her first Olympic gold medal as they beat France 86-50 for the gold medal. Charles played for Team USA during the 2016 Summer Olympics, helping them win their sixth gold medal as they defeated Spain 101-72. Charles would earn her second Olympic gold medal.

She was drafted seventh overall by the Seattle Storm in the 2014 WNBA draft and was immediately traded to the Washington Mystics. Hartley played shooting guard for the UConn women's basketball team, and won back to back national championships in 2013 and 2014. Early life[edit] Hartley is the daughter of Dennis and Simone Hartley.[1][2] She started playing basketball at a very young age, and honed her game in her driveway, playing against two older brothers. They pushed her around, but she credits that for making her tougher.[1][2][3] High school career[edit] Hartley attended North Babylon High School in North Babylon, New York. Hartley began playing with North Babylon's varsity squad as an eighth grader. During her junior year, she averaged 21 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 6.0 steals and 4.7 blocks per game and was named to the Parade All-America list.[4] Hartley was also recognized as New York Gatorade Player of the Year for athletic excellence, academic achievement and exemplary character. As a senior, she had five triple doubles, and averaged 30 points, 8.3 rebounds 7.4 assists, 5.9 steals and 5.0 blocks per game.[5][6] She led her team to the state championship, where she poured in 51 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome a balanced attack by Sachem East.[7][8] She was named New York Gatorade Player of the Year and New York Miss Basketball. Hartley finished as North Babylon's all-time leader in points (1,978). Hartley was selected to play at the McDonald's All-American Game,[9] she scored 17 points and WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored 19 points.[10][11][12] In addition to basketball, she also participated in soccer and lacrosse. She earned a Suffolk County Legislature proclamation for high academic achievement, community service and excellence in basketball. Before her final season began at North Babylon High School, Hartley committed to the University of Connecticut. College career[edit] Freshman year[edit] Freshmen rarely start at UConn, but Caroline Doty, expected to be a starting guard for the team, suffered an ACL injury in August 2010 which kept her out of the lineup for the entire season. With limited options, Hartley started and played a total of 1,209 minutes, the most ever by a UConn freshman. She averaged 12.4 points per game and was named the Big East Freshman of the Year, and Big East all tournament team. Sophomore year[edit] Hartley improved her statistics from her freshman season. During her sophomore season, she averaged 14.0 points per game and 3.7 assists per game. Throughout the season, she shot 46.5% from the field, 33% from three-point range, and 75.6% from the free throw line. She was named first-team All-Big East, and she was named to the BIG EAST All-Tournament after she scored 18 points against Notre Dame in the BIG EAST Final. Hartley earned her spot on the Huskies wall of fame by being one of 10 candidates named to the WBCA/State Farm All American team.[5] Junior year[edit] Hartley finished her junior season averaging 9.2 points and 4.5 assists per game. After a stellar sophomore season, Hartley had a dip in production. She had career lows in minutes played, points, rebounds, field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and free throw percentage. Her statistical drops are in part credited to a case of ankle injury that Hartley was fighting all year long. She came back strong in the NCAA tournament, helping her team win the National Championship. Hartley was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament team.[13] Senior year[edit] In her final year at UConn, Hartley was named to the All-American Athletic first team after averaging 16.2 points, 4.3 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Hartley was also a consensus second-team all-American as a senior, and started every game as the Huskies won their second straight national championship. Hartley led UConn to a 144-11 record over her four-year career, which included four Final Four appearances and back to back National Championships. One of only two Huskies, along with Maya Moore as the only players with 1,500 points, 500 rebounds, 500 assists, and 200 steals. She finished her career ranking eighth in points (1,994), sixth in three-point field goals made (557) and games played (153), and fifth in assists (559).

The Mystics finished 3rd place in the Eastern Conference with a 16-18 record but were eliminated by the Indiana Fever in a 2-game sweep of the first round. In 2015, Hartley would sit out the first 6 games of the season due to a right foot stress fracture.[16][17] She would eventually make her return and played 25 games with minimal playing time while on minutes restriction. The Mystics finished 4th place in the Eastern Conference with an 18-16 record, however they would once again get eliminated in the first round after losing in 3 games to the New York Liberty, Hartley was unable to keep playing for the rest of the series after Game 1. In 2016, Hartley had slightly increased playing time from last season. After playing 24 games, it was announced that Hartley became pregnant with her first child and would sit out the rest of the season.[18] The Mystics went on to finish 13-21, missing out on the playoffs. In January 2017, Hartley was traded to her home state team, the New York Liberty in a three-team trade deal that sent teammate Kia Vaughn also to the Liberty, Carolyn Swords along with the 15th overall pick in the 2017 WNBA draft to the Seattle Storm and the Mystics receiving the Storm's first and second round draft picks in the 2017 WNBA draft.[19] On May 13, 2017, Hartley made her Liberty debut and recorded 3 assists and 4 rebounds in 18 minutes of play in a 73-64 win over the San Antonio Stars. On June 16, 2017, Hartley scored a season-high 17 points in 102-93 win over the Dallas Wings.[20] The Liberty would finish the season on a 10-game winning streak and the number 3 seed in the league, receiving a bye to the second round under the league's new playoff format which was put into effect last season.

Mabrey was drafted in the second round (19th pick overall) by the Los Angeles Sparks in the 2019 WNBA draft. She previously played with the United States women's national under-19 basketball team and the University of Notre Dame. Mabrey was traded to the Dallas Wings in 2020.[3] She has played internationally in Latvia (TTT Riga),[4] Israel (Bnot Hertzeliya),[5] Australia (Perth Lynx),[6] Italy (PF Schio),[7] and Turkey (Çukurova Basketbol). She also played in the inaugural season of Unrivaled,[8] the 3-on-3 league developed by WNBA players Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier; however, Mabrey was sidelined for all but 3 games of the Unrivaled season due to a calf injury.[8][9] Early life[edit] Mabrey was raised in Belmar, New Jersey to Patti and Roy Mabrey.[10] She has two brothers, Ryan and Roy, and two sisters Michaela and Dara. It was Roy's and Michaela's love of basketball that first involved Marina in the game. Her mother coached basketball in their area and Marina, Roy and Michaela would go along with their mother and join in the practices. Fierce basketball competition became a part of family life in the Mabrey household with Marina frequently competing with her older brother and sister in their driveway and local park.[11][12][13] Mabrey attended Manasquan High School in Manasquan, New Jersey, where she was part of two teams that won the state Tournament of Champions[14] and shared most valuable player honors in the McDonald's All-American Game in 2015.[13] Despite her sister Michaela's success as part of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team,[12] Marina doubted whether or not to choose that college when she was considering many offers for a basketball scholarship after high school. She chose to join up with coach Muffet McGraw's squad at Notre Dame in 2015.[13] College career[edit] Mabrey joined sister Michaela in the 2015-16 Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team, following a season in which the team were runners-up in the national championship but required some rebuilding. She quickly established herself and won ""rookie of the week"" in November 2015 after recording a triple-double at Valparaiso. Her 35 appearances as a rookie, 85 three-pointers (which ranks as the second most for a single season in program history) and an impressive 10.7 points per game gained her honors in the ACC All-Freshman Team (Blue Ribbon Panel & Coaches) and ACC All-Academic Team.[15] The 2016-17 Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team reached the Elite Eight but fell for the second year running to Stanford Cardinal women's basketball. Mabrey was chosen along with Arike Ogunbowale and Lindsay Allen for the regional all-tournament team.[15] The Notre Dame team for the following two years saw records fall, two national championship games and one championship victory. Mabrey was a key component of a team that survived a rash of injuries that won the 2018 national championship and commented later that the injuries had given the now smaller team an added mental toughness that ""there is no-one else to sub in"" and that they had to battle through.[16] The fighting mentality led to comebacks throughout the season with Mabrey moving to a more direct point guard role and taking more leadership with the largest fightback in Notre Dame history coming back against Tennessee from 23 points behind. The team executed the largest comeback in a championship game in NCAA women's basketball history, overcoming a 15-point deficit to achieve a 61-58 victory over fellow No. 1 seed Mississippi State.[17] She graduated in 2019 as Notre Dame's all-time leader in made three-pointers with 274; 1,896 career points ranks eighth all-time and a career 81.7 percent from the line - ranking sixth for Notre Dame.[15] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] Los Angeles Sparks (2019)[edit] Mabrey with the LA Sparks in 2019. Mabrey was drafted 19th overall in the 2019 WNBA draft by the Los Angeles Sparks.[18][19] The Sparks, under new head coach Derek Fisher, reached the play-off semi-finals with a regular season record of 22-12.[20] Mabrey saw limited minutes during the playoffs.[21] She appeared in 31 games with the Sparks during her rookie season and averaged 4.0 points, 1.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists while shooting 34.4% from the field.[22] Dallas Wings (2020-2022)[edit] Mabrey with the Dallas Wings in 2021. Prior to the 2020 WNBA season, Mabrey was traded by the Sparks to the Dallas Wings for a 2021 second round draft choice.[22] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 WNBA season was reduced to a 22-game regular season at IMG Academy, without fans present.[23] In 19 games for the Wings, Mabrey averaged 10.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game.[24] Mabrey returned to the Dallas Wings for the 2021 WNBA season.[24] Chicago Sky (2023-2024)[edit] On February 11, 2023, Mabrey was traded to the Chicago Sky in a four-team trade also involving the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury, Dallas Wings.[25] Connecticut Sun (2024-present)[edit] On July 17, 2024, Mabrey was traded to the Connecticut Sun (along with a 2025 2nd round draft pick) from the Chicago Sky, in exchange for guards Rachel Banham and Moriah Jefferson, a 2025 1st round pick, and the rights to swap 2026 first round picks.[26] Overseas[edit] For the 2019-20 season, Mabrey moved to Latvia to play for TTT Riga.[27] In her first game[28] she scored 24 points and led her team with eight rebounds to win 89-81 over defending champions UMMC Ekaterinburg which contained WNBA players Brittney Griner, Courtney Vandersloot and Emma Meesseman. Riga won only two of the following nine matches that were played.[29] Mabrey settled in well in a young team[30] and at the suspension of play she was eighth in the league in points per game (15.8).[31] She left Latvia in mid-March after European play was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[32][33] For the 2020-21 season, Mabrey moved to Israel to play for Bnot Hertzeliya. In 22 games, she averaged 23.2 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 2.4 steals per game.[24] Mabrey and Jackie Young with the Perth Lynx in December 2021 Mabrey signed with the Perth Lynx in Australia for the 2021-22 WNBL season.[34] In her debut for the Lynx on January 2, 2022, she scored a game-high 30 points with seven 3-pointers in an 88-86 loss to the Adelaide Lightning.[35] On January 23, she scored 34 points in an 86-81 win over the Sydney Uni Flames.[36] Following this game, she was unavailable for over a month due to a foot injury[37][38] but returned to contribute to the Lynx ending the season as runners-up in the WBNL to Melbourne Boomers after losing the final series by two matches to one.[39] In 2023, she won her first national title since the 2018 NCAA tournament when she and team Famila Schio won the Coppa Italia beating Venezia 73-62 with Mabrey scoring eleven points in the final.[40] Having qualified for the Scudetto playoffs, Mabrey's twenty four points and dominant performance in the third quarter of the quarter final pulled her team from a weak first half against Campobasso to a twenty four point victory.

Regarded as one of the greatest female collegiate players, Clark was twice named national female college basketball player of the year while playing for the Iowa Hawkeyes; she remains the NCAA Division I all-time leading scorer. She has helped popularize women's basketball, a phenomenon dubbed the ""Caitlin Clark effect."" Clark attended Dowling Catholic High School in her hometown of West Des Moines, Iowa, where she was named a McDonald's All-American[1] and rated the fourth-best player in her class by ESPN.[2] In her freshman season with Iowa, she led the NCAA Division I in scoring and earned All-American honors. As a sophomore, Clark was a unanimous first-team All-American[3] and became the first women's player to lead Division I in points and assists in a single season. In her junior season, she was the national player of the year and led Iowa to its first national championship game, again leading Division I in assists and setting Big Ten single-season marks in points and assists. As a senior, she repeated as national player of the year and helped Iowa return to the national title game. She also set the Division I women's career and single-season record in points and three-pointers, broke the conference record in assists, and led the nation in points and assists. At the youth international level, Clark won three gold medals with the United States, including two at the FIBA Under-19 Women's World Cup, where she was named Most Valuable Player in 2021. Clark was selected first overall by the Indiana Fever in the 2024 WNBA draft. In her first season, she won the WNBA Rookie of the Year award and made the All-WNBA First Team and WNBA All-Star Game. She set league single-season and single-game records in assists, broke the rookie scoring record, and became the first rookie to achieve a triple-double. Early life Caitlin Elizabeth Clark[4][5] was born on January 22, 2002, in Des Moines, Iowa, to Brent Clark, a vice president at a product company, and Anne Clark (née Nizzi). Anne's father was the football coach and a school administrator at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines. Caitlin grew up in the city.[6][7][8] She began playing basketball at age five and competed in boys' recreational leagues, because her father could not find a girls' league for her age group.[6][9] Clark also played softball, volleyball, soccer, tennis, and golf as a child before focusing on basketball.[7][10] At age 13, she began playing several years ahead of her age group in girls' leagues.[11] In sixth grade, she joined All Iowa Attack, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball program based in Ames, Iowa, and played for teams in the program until graduating from high school.[7][12] She was coached by Dickson Jensen with Attack, and her AAU teammates included future Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) player Ashley Joens.[13][14][15] Clark drew inspiration from Maya Moore of the Minnesota Lynx, the closest WNBA team to her hometown, and often attended their games with her father.[16] She admired All Iowa Attack alumnus Harrison Barnes and became a fan of the North Carolina Tar Heels after Barnes joined the program.[12] High school career Clark played four years of varsity basketball for Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines under head coach Kristin Meyer.[17] As a freshman, she averaged 15.3 points, 4.7 assists and 2.3 steals per game.[18] She earned Class 5A All-State third-team accolades from the Iowa Newspaper Association and All-Iowa honorable mention from The Des Moines Register.[n 1][20][21] Clark led her team to a 19-5 record and the Class 5A state tournament, where they lost to eventual champions Valley High School in the first round.[22] In her sophomore season, she averaged 27.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2.3 steals per game, ranking second in the state in scoring.[6][23] Clark was named first-team Class 5A All-State by the Iowa Print Sports Writers Association (IPSWA) and Central Iowa Metro League Player of the Year by The Des Moines Register.[24] She helped Dowling reach the Class 5A state quarterfinals and achieve a 20-4 record.[25] After being the penultimate cut from the 12-player Team USA roster for the Under-17 FIBA World Cup in the summer of 2018, Clark used this as motivation and began developing her pull-up jump shot as well as her deep step-back.[26] That same summer, she led the All Iowa Attack to win the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League championship, scoring 23 points in a 64-61 victory over the Cal Storm in the final.[27] On February 4, 2019, during her junior season, Clark scored 60 points in a 90-78 win against Mason City High School. Her 60-point game was the second-highest single-game point total in Iowa five-on-five girls' basketball history, surpassed only by Abby Roe in 1996. She also set the state single-game record with 13 three-pointers.[28] On February 25, Clark set the Class 5A state tournament single-game scoring record with 42 points in a 75-70 triple-overtime win over Waukee High School in the quarterfinals.[29] She helped Dowling reach the semifinals of the tournament and finish with a 17-8 record.[30] As a junior, Clark led the state in scoring and averaged 32.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.3 steals per game.[31][32] She was named Iowa Gatorade Player of the Year and repeated as a Class 5A All-State first-team selection by the IPSWA.[32][33] As a senior, Clark averaged 33.4 points, eight rebounds, four assists and 2.7 steals per game,[34] leading the state in scoring for a second time. Her team finished with a 19-4 record and reached the Class 5A regional final, where they were upset by Sioux City East High School. Clark finished her career with the fourth-most points (2,547) and the sixth-most three-pointers (283) in Iowa five-on-five history.[35] She was awarded Iowa Gatorade Player of the Year,[34] Des Moines Register All-Iowa Athlete of the Year,[36] and Iowa Miss Basketball, while making the IPSWA Class 5A All-State first-team.[37] Clark was selected to compete in the McDonald's All-American Game and the Jordan Brand Classic, two prestigious high school all-star games,[38][39] but both games were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[40] In her first two years at Dowling, Clark was a starter on the school's varsity soccer team but focused on basketball for her final two years.[36] In her freshman season, she scored 23 goals and was named to the Class 3A All-Iowa team by The Des Moines Register.[18][41] Recruiting Clark was recruited by NCAA Division I basketball programs before starting high school, receiving her first letter of interest from Missouri State before seventh grade.[12][42] By her sophomore season at Dowling Catholic, she was ranked the number one player in the 2020 high school class by ESPN.[43] At the end of her high school career, she was considered a five-star recruit and the fourth-best player in her class by ESPN.[44] Her family wanted her to choose Notre Dame, and she made a verbal commitment to the school's then-head coach Muffet McGraw. However, Clark never signed a National Letter of Intent with the school, and soon reconsidered,[45] announcing on November 12, 2019, that she would commit to play college basketball for Iowa over offers from Iowa State and Notre Dame.[46] Clark was drawn to the team's up-tempo style of offense and head coach Lisa Bluder's development of point guards. She also expected to immediately have a key role on the team with the departure of Kathleen Doyle, the reigning Big Ten Player of the Year.[47] College career 2020-21: Freshman season Clark entered her freshman season as Iowa's starting point guard.[48] She assumed a leading role alongside starting center Monika Czinano; the duo was nicknamed ""The Law Firm"" by analyst Christy Winters-Scott.[49][50] On November 25, 2020, she made her collegiate debut, recording 27 points, eight rebounds, and four assists in a 96-81 win over Northern Iowa.[51] In her second game, on December 2, she posted her first double-double with 30 points and 13 assists in a 103-97 victory over Drake.[52] On December 22, in a 92-65 victory over Western Illinois, she registered the first triple-double by an Iowa player since Samantha Logic did so in 2015. Despite shooting 3-of-15 from the field, Clark had 13 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists during the game.[53] On January 6, 2021, she recorded 37 points, 11 rebounds and four assists in a 92-79 win against Minnesota.[54] Clark posted a season-high 39 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in an 88-81 win over Nebraska on February 11,[55] breaking the single-game scoring record for Pinnacle Bank Arena, the home venue of Nebraska.[56] On February 28, she scored 18 points and had a season-high 14 assists in an 84-70 win over Wisconsin.[57] At the end of the regular season, Clark was a unanimous Big Ten Freshman of the Year and first-team All-Big Ten selection. She was a 13-time Big Ten Freshman of the Week, setting a conference record, and led the Big Ten with five Player of the Week awards.[58] Clark helped Iowa achieve a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament, where she was named to the all-tournament team and recorded 37 assists, the most in the event's history.[59] In the second round of the NCAA tournament, she posted 35 points, seven rebounds and six assists in an 86-72 win over Kentucky. She broke program single-game records for points and three-pointers (6) in the tournament.[60] Iowa reached the Sweet 16, where Clark scored 21 points in a 92-72 loss to first-seeded UConn.[61] She was named a first-team All-American by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), a second-team All-American by the Associated Press (AP) and made the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) Coaches' All-America team.[62] Clark became the first freshman to win the Dawn Staley Award, which honors the best Division I guard.[63] She shared two major Division I freshman of the year awards with Paige Bueckers of UConn: the Tamika Catchings Award, presented by the USBWA,[64] and the WBCA Freshman of the Year award.[65] As a freshman, Clark averaged 26.6 points, 7.1 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game. She led the NCAA Division I in scoring and ranked second in assists and three-pointers per game. Her totals in points, assists, field goals and three-pointers also led Division I. She set program freshman records for points and assists and had the fourth-highest scoring average in Iowa history.[63] 2021-22: Sophomore season Clark during her 46-point game against Michigan in 2022 On November 9, 2021, Clark made her sophomore season debut, recording 26 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a 93-50 win over New Hampshire.[66] On January 2, 2022, she posted 44 points and eight assists in a 93-56 win over Evansville. Clark broke the Carver-Hawkeye Arena women's single-game scoring record and surpassed Kelsey Mitchell of Ohio State as the fastest Big Ten player to reach 1,000 career points.[67] On January 16, 2022, she recorded her fourth career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 93-83 victory over Nebraska.[68] In her next game, four days later, Clark posted 35 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists in a 105-49 win over Minnesota. She became the first Division I men's or women's player to record consecutive triple-doubles with at least 30 points and the first women's player in Big Ten history with consecutive triple-doubles.[69] On January 25, Clark had 18 assists,[n 2] which set program and tied conference single-game records, in addition to 20 points and seven rebounds in a 107-79 win against Penn State.[74][75] On January 31, she recorded 43 points, seven assists and four rebounds in a 92-88 loss to Ohio State.[77] On February 6, Clark scored a season-high 46 points, including 25 in the fourth quarter, and had 10 assists in a 98-90 loss to Michigan.[78] She set the women's single-game scoring record for Crisler Center, the home arena of Michigan.[79] After leading Iowa to a share of the Big Ten regular season title, she was unanimously named Big Ten Player of the Year and first-team All-Big Ten by the league's coaches and media.[80][81] On March 5, 2022, in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament, Clark recorded 41 points and nine rebounds in an 83-66 win over Nebraska.[82] She led Iowa to the title and was named the tournament's most outstanding player (MOP).[80] Her team was upset by 10th-seeded Creighton in the second round of the NCAA tournament, where Clark was held to a season-low 15 points and 11 assists, shooting 4-of-19 from the field, in a 64-62 loss.[83] She was a unanimous first-team All-American: she earned first-team All-American honors from the AP and the USBWA, and was a WBCA Coaches' All-America Team selection.[84] For her sophomore year, she was named a first-team Division I Academic All-American by the College Sports Information Directors of America, since renamed College Sports Communicators (CSC).[85] Clark became the first back-to-back recipient of the Dawn Staley Award and won the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top Division I point guard.[86] As a sophomore, she averaged 27 points, eight rebounds and eight assists per game. Clark was the first women's player to lead Division I in points and assists per game in a single season. She also led Division I in total points, free throws and triple-doubles.[73] 2022-23: Junior season Entering her junior season, Clark was a unanimous selection for the AP preseason All-America team and was named Big Ten preseason player of the year by the league's coaches and media.[87][88] On November 18, 2022, she suffered an ankle injury with 3.8 seconds left in an 84-83 loss to Kansas State, where she recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.[89] She played in Iowa's next game against Belmont on November 20, scoring 33 points in a 73-62 victory.[90] On December 1, she scored a season-high 45 points in a 94-81 loss to NC State.[91] Three days later, Clark posted her seventh career triple-double, with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 102-71 win over Wisconsin. She surpassed Samantha Logic as the Big Ten career leader in triple-doubles.[92] On December 21, in her 75th game, Clark tied Elena Delle Donne of Delaware as the fastest Division I women's player to reach 2,000 career points since the 1999-2000 season, scoring 20 points in a 92-54 win over Dartmouth.[93] On January 23, 2023, Clark recorded 28 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in an 83-72 win over AP No. 2 Ohio State, who were previously unbeaten.[94] On February 2, she had 42 points, eight assists and seven rebounds in a 96-82 victory over Maryland.[95] On February 26, Clark recorded 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, making a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer, in an 86-85 win against AP No. 2 Indiana.[96] At the end of the regular season, she repeated as Big Ten Player of the Year in a unanimous vote and was named first-team All-Big Ten by the league's coaches and media.[97][98] Clark with Iowa at the 2023 Big Ten tournament Clark led Iowa to its second consecutive Big Ten tournament championship, where she earned MOP honors. In the title game, she recorded 30 points, 17 assists and 10 rebounds in a 105-72 win over Ohio State, the first triple-double in the final of the tournament. She moved to second in Division I women's history behind Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon with her tenth career triple-double.[99] In the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, she recorded 41 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 97-83 win over Louisville. She became the first player in men's or women's tournament history to record a 30 or 40-point triple-double.[100] During the game, Clark became the first Division I player to record at least 900 points and 300 assists in a single season.[101] For her performance, Clark was named the Seattle 4 Regional Most Outstanding Player and to the regional all-tournament team[102] as Iowa reached its first Final Four since 1993.[103] In the Final Four, she posted 41 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in a 77-73 upset win over undefeated defending champion South Carolina, ending their 42-game winning streak.[104][105] She broke the single-game scoring record for the women's tournament semifinals and became the first player in tournament history with consecutive 40-point games.[106] Clark also surpassed the program and Big Ten single-season scoring records held by Megan Gustafson.[107] With the win, Iowa advanced to their first women's basketball championship game in program history.[105] Though Clark had 30 points and eight assists against LSU in the national championship, Iowa lost the game, 102-85. She made eight three-pointers, the most by a men's or women's player in the title game.[108][109] Near the end of the game, LSU star Angel Reese followed Clark, making a ""you can't see me"" gesture implying that Clark could not keep up with her, and also pointing to her ring finger in reference to LSU's imminent championship ring.[110] Reese received considerable criticism for the gestures, which many in the media viewed as unsportsmanlike. However, many also defended Reese's gestures and trash talk, highlighting a double standard, as Clark had made the same gesture at a previous game and did not face similar criticism.[110][111] The gesture was made by Clark towards Iowa staff member Kathryn Reynolds.[112] Clark herself defended Reese over criticism about the gesture.[110][113] In coverage of this incident, journalists and the public have commented on the roles of race and gender in perceptions of sportsmanship.[110][114] The incident has also been described as the origin of a rivalry between Clark and Reese.[115] With 191 points in the tournament, Clark broke the men's and women's scoring records for a single NCAA tournament.

She can pass ahead in transition and find her teammates through defensive traffic.[258] Her combination of scoring and passing skills helps her excel in the pick and roll.[259] Her high turnover rate, in part due to her aggressive style of play and ball-handling usage, has been criticized.[194][260] Writers have likened Clark's talent and personality to Diana Taurasi.[261][262] Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder compared her to Sue Bird and Sabrina Ionescu.[256] Clark has modeled parts of her game after Maya Moore, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Pete Maravich.[11] Impact Clark signing autographs after a game in 2024 Widely considered a generational talent,[263] Clark is described as one of the greatest women's college basketball players of all time by many publications.[264][265][266][267] In part due to her unprecedented shooting range and proficiency among female players, she has been labeled a transformative player in women's basketball.[268] Her impact on the women's game is likened to that of Stephen Curry on the men's game.[269] USA Today stated that she, like Curry, has ""redefined what a good shot is in basketball.""[270] The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Gay wrote in 2024: ""Clark is far from the first great shooter in women's basketball, but she's the one who is changing the dimensionality of the game, because of the distance she can shoot from and how well she can pass.""[271] Clark is credited with popularizing women's basketball since her college career at Iowa, a phenomenon known as the ""Caitlin Clark effect"".[272] In her senior season, publications attributed a rise in attendance and television viewership for the sport to Clark.[273][274] As a junior, she helped the 2023 national championship game become the most-viewed women's college basketball game in history (9.9 million).[275] Before her senior season, her team set the women's basketball attendance record (55,646) in a preseason exhibition game.[133] The Iowa women's basketball program sold out its 2023-24 ticket slate and generated $3.26 million in ticket sale revenue, the most in history by a women's college basketball team.[276] At the 2024 NCAA tournament, Clark's final three games each broke the women's college basketball viewership record, culminating with 18.9 million viewers for the national championship game. It was the most-viewed basketball game at any level since 2019 and the first women's NCAA tournament final to draw more viewers than the men's final.[277][278] In her first WNBA season with the Indiana Fever, she continued to drive historic attendance and viewership.[279] The Fever set a franchise single-season attendance record, and their regular season finale set the league attendance record (20,711).[280][281] As Clark drew a larger audience to the WNBA, some players accused members of her fan base of racist, sexist, and homophobic abuse, particularly on social media.[282] Clark has denounced the harassment of players, calling those members of her fan base trolls and not genuine fans.[282][283] Career statistics Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game TO Turnovers per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led Division I degrees Led the league ‡ WNBA record WNBA Regular season Stats current as of game on July 15, 2025 WNBA regular season statistics[284][285] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2024 Indiana 40 degrees 40 degrees 35.4 .417 .344 .906 5.7 8.4 degrees 1.3 0.7 5.6 19.2 2025 Indiana 13 13 31.1 .367 .279 .820 5.0 8.8 1.6 0.5 5.1 16.5 Career 2 years, 1 team 53 53 34.3 .405 .329 .887 5.5 8.5 1.4 0.6 5.5 18.5 All-Star 1 1 26.0 .222 .000 -- 1.0 10.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 Playoffs WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2024 Indiana 2 2 38.0 .350 .200 .750 5.0 8.5 2.0 1.0 2.5 18.0 Career 1 year, 1 team 2 2 38.0 .350 .200 .750 5.0 8.5 2.0 1.0 2.5 18.0 College NCAA statistics[286] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2020-21 Iowa 30 30 34.0 .472 .406 .858 5.9 7.0 1.3 0.5 4.8 26.6* 2021-22 Iowa 32 32 35.9 .452 .332 .881 8.0 8.0* 1.5 0.6 4.8 27.0* 2022-23 Iowa 38 38 34.4 .473 .389 .839 7.1 8.6* 1.5 0.5 4.2 27.8 2023-24 Iowa 39 39 34.8 .455 .378 .860 7.4 8.9* 1.8 0.5 4.7 31.6* Career 139 139 34.8 .462 .377 .858 7.1 8.2 1.5 0.5 4.8 28.4 Off the court Personal life Clark's father, Brent Clark, is a sales executive at Concentric International and played basketball and baseball at Simpson College.[11][256] Her mother, Anne Nizzi-Clark, who is of Italian descent, is a former marketing executive and the daughter of former Dowling Catholic High School football coach, Bob Nizzi.[7] Clark has an older brother, Blake, who played college football for Iowa State, and a younger brother, Colin.[7] Her cousin, Audrey Faber, played college basketball for Creighton.[43] Two of Clark's uncles are former college athletes: Tom Faber played basketball for Drake and Utica, and Mike Nizzi played football for Nebraska-Omaha.[6] She has been in a relationship with Connor McCaffery, who played basketball and baseball at Iowa and is the son of former Hawkeyes men's basketball head coach, Fran McCaffery, since 2023.[10][287] Clark was raised in the Catholic Church and is a parishioner at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Des Moines.[288][289][290] Clark majored in marketing at the University of Iowa, graduating in May 2024.[122][291] Clark is an avid golfer, having played the sport since childhood.

As part of a skit during the Weekend Update segment, she criticized co-anchor Michael Che's past jokes about women's basketball and wrote new jokes for him to read aloud.[325] Clark served as an executive producer on the ESPN+ docuseries Full Court Press, which premiered in May 2024. The series followed three women's college basketball players, including Clark herself, during the 2023-24 season.[326] On February 9, 2025, Clark appeared in a 90-second Nike commercial in the 2025 Super Bowl featuring some of the world's top female athletes. It was Nike's first Super Bowl ad since 1998.[327] Philanthropy Clark speaking at an event for the Caitlin Clark Foundation in 2024 In March 2022, Clark partnered with the Coralville Community Food Pantry in Coralville, Iowa, for a month-long donation push and meet-and-greet to ""Team Up Against Hunger"", encouraging $22 donations from the public as a nod to Clark's jersey number.[328] In the first year of this partnership, they raised over $23,000 for the food pantry.[329] A year later, Clark and the Coralville Community Food Pantry teamed up again, this time raising over $75,000 for the nonprofit in thirty days.[329][330] As of 2024,[update] Clark has helped raise over $100,000 for Coralville Community Food Pantry, and the nonprofit continues to frequently receive $22 donations.[331] In October 2023, Clark formed the Caitlin Clark Foundation, a nonprofit organization with a mission ""to uplift and improve the lives of youth and their communities through education, nutrition, and sport.""[332] Beneficiaries from the Caitlin Clark Foundation include University of Iowa Children's Hospital, the Coralville Community Food Pantry, the Boys & Girls Clubs within Iowa, and the Iowa-East Central Special Olympics chapter.[332][333] Many of Clark's sponsorship and endorsement deals have included pledges of support, monetary donations, or product donations to the Caitlin Clark Foundation, including Gainbridge, Gatorade, Hy-Vee, State Farm, and Wilson Sporting Goods.[334][335][336][337][338] In January 2025 on Clark's 23rd birthday, the Caitlin Clark Foundation teamed up

their round-up campaign.[345] The donation is estimated to provide about 3 million meals to food insecure communities in the Midwest via eighteen Feeding America partner food banks.[346] In popular culture In 2023, the Iowa State Fair displayed a life-size butter sculpture of Clark.[347] On February 22, 2024, the Iowa House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution declaring February 22 as ""Caitlin Clark Day"" in the state, in reference to her jersey number.[348] In the next month, members of Iowa's federal delegation, including senators, Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, and representative, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, introduced a resolution to recognize Clark for breaking the NCAA Division I scoring record.[349] In 2024, an autographed trading card featuring Clark sold for $78,000, the most ever for a women's basketball card.[350] The record was broken later that year after her card sold for $84,000, the second-most expensive card of a female athlete behind tennis player Serena Williams.[351] In February 2024, Clark became the top-selling college athlete on the online sports merchandise retailer Fanatics, surpassing Colorado Buffaloes quarterback, Shedeur Sanders.[352] In 2024, Clark was included in the World's 100 Most Powerful Women list by Forbes, becoming the first basketball player and the second athlete in the past 20 years to appear on the

As a junior, Colson earned All-Greater Houston honors, averaging 16.2 points and 4.2 assists per game.

With 12.5 seconds left on the clock, Colson rushed Chicago guard Courtney Vandersloot in an effort to foul her, leading Vandersloot to attempt a jump pass to Diamond DeShields, which was subsequently stolen by Aces teammate Dearica Hamby.[37] With 5.3 seconds remaining, Hamby scored a game-winning three-pointer from half-court, sending the Aces onto the semifinals.[25] Chicago Sky (2020)[edit] On February 13, 2020, Colson was signed by the Chicago Sky.[38] In June 2020, Colson tested positive for COVID-19, missing the beginning of the abbreviated 2020 WNBA season.[39] After recovering from her bout with coronavirus, Colson joined the Sky in July 2020 in the Wubble at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.[40] Athletes Unlimited (2021-present)[edit] During the 2021-22 WNBA offseason, Colson played in Las Vegas with Athletes Unlimited during the development league's inaugural season, serving on player executive committee.[41] In October 2022, it was announced that Colson would rejoin Athletes Unlimited for the 2023 season.[42] Las Vegas Aces (2022-2024)[edit] On March 2, 2022, Colson signed with the Las Vegas Aces as a free agent. Colson's return to the Aces marked her third stint with the franchise, in part on the strength of her performance during the 2021 Athletes Unlimited season.[43] She played in 18 games during the 2022 WNBA season, during which the Aces won both the second-ever WNBA Commissioner's Cup and the 2022 WNBA Finals, felling the Connecticut Sun 3-1 in four games.[44] Colson re-signed with Las Vegas for the 2023 WNBA season on February 7, 2023.[45] In 28 appearances, Colson averaged 4.8 minutes a game coming off the Aces' bench, almost entirely in garbage time.[46] In Game 4 of the 2023 WNBA Finals against the New York Liberty, after injuries sidelined starters Chelsea Gray and Kiah Stokes, Colson's defense played a key role in the Aces' 70-69 victory.[47] During post-game interviews, Colson took the mic from ESPN reporter Holly Rowe to say ""Night, night!"", using Stephen Curry's sleeping celebration in a moment that went viral.[48] Indiana Fever (2025-present)[edit] On February 5, 2025, Colson signed a one-year deal with the Indiana Fever.[49][50] Coaching career[edit] After playing overseas in Poland, Colson returned to her alma mater Texas A&M in January 2014 as a graduate assistant, reuniting with her college coach Gary Blair.[51] During her first season as a graduate assistant, the Aggies made a run to the Elite Eight before falling 69-54 to no. 1 seed and eventual champions UConn.[52] She served as video coordinator for the 2014-15 season.[53] On May 4, 2015, Colson was hired as an assistant coach for the Rice University Owls, joining head coach Tina Langley.[54] Colson joined Langley's coaching staff with the stipulation that she would have permission to pursue opportunities to play professionally.[55] Eleven days after joining the Rice staff, Colson signed with the San Antonio Stars.[24] While playing for the Stars, Colson spent the 2015-16 and 2016-17 offseasons as an assistant coach at Rice, with the Owls improving by 13 wins between her first to her second season.[56] In 2017, Rice won the Women's Basketball Invitational for the first time ever, defeating UNC Greensboro 74-62.[57] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader † Denotes season(s) in which Colson won a WNBA championship * Denotes season(s) in which Colson won an NCAA Championship WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[58] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2011 New York 16 0 5.4 .350 .429 .833 0.4 0.6 0.3 0.1 1.1 1.4 2012 Did not play (waived) 2013 Did not appear in WNBA 2014 2015 San Antonio 34 5 15.9 .411 .318 .686 1.1 2.8 0.8 0.3 1.2 3.5 2016 San Antonio 34 0 16.9 .431 .192 .831 1.6 2.6 1.1 0.0 1.5 5.1 2017 San Antonio 28 4 11.6 .330 .200 .688 0.5 2.0 0.5 0.1 1.0 2.9 2018 Minnesota 2 0 8.5 .429 .000 .500 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.5 2.0 3.5 2019 Las Vegas 33 0 11.5 .440 .450 .818 0.7 1.8 0.9 0.1 0.8 3.3 2020 Chicago 17 0 6.5 .429 .333 .875 0.4 0.8 0.4 0.0 0.8 1.6 2021 Did not appear in WNBA 2022† Las Vegas 18 0 6.8 .313 .273 1.000 0.4 1.0 0.1 0.0 0.4 1.6 2023† Las Vegas 28 0 4.8 .444 .375 .833 0.4 0.8 0.3 0.0 0.2 1.3 2024 Las Vegas 31 1 8.0 .422 .378 .889 0.5 1.0 0.5 0.2 0.5 2.5 Career 10 years, 4 teams 241 10 10.5 .405 .325 .785 0.8 1.6 0.6 0.1 0.9 2.8 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2011 New York 1 0 2.0 -- -- -- 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2019 Las Vegas 5 0 2.8 .167 .000 .500 0.2 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.2 0.6 2020 Chicago 1 0 0.0 -- -- -- 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2022† Las Vegas 4 0 4.8 .000 .000 -- 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.0 2023† Las Vegas 7 0 4.9 .250 .000 -- 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.4 0.3 2024 Las Vegas 6 0 4.7 .143 .167 .500 0.0 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.7 0.7 Career 6 years, 3 teams 24 0 4.0 .143 .111 .500 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.4 College[edit] NCAA statistics[59][60] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2007-08 Texas A&M 35 -- 10.9 .339 .218 .614 1.0 1.3 1.1 0.1 1.5 3.2 2008-09 Texas A&M 35 -- 22.3 .389 .330 .750 1.3 3.0 2.1 0.2 2.3 6.5 2009-10 Texas A&M 30 19 20.5 .449 .377 .648 1.6 4.3 1.7 0.2 2.3 7.3 2010-11* Texas A&M 36 33 25.9 .398 .301 .730 2.3 6.1 2.4 0.1 2.8 8.0 Career 138 -- 52 .398 .312 .687 1.5 3.7 1.8 0.1 2.2 6.2 Personal life[edit] Colson has two siblings, Simmie IV and Simone.[61] She is openly lesbian.[62] Colson began taking acting classes in January 2021.[63] Colson is close friends with former Aces teammate Theresa Plaisance, with whom she starred in The Syd & TP Show, an unscripted buddy comedy series co-produced by Ryan Reynolds's Maximum Effort and Fubo.

She played college basketball for the Missouri Tigers. Early life and education[edit] Cunningham was born August 16, 1996, to Jim and Paula Cunningham.[1] Her parents had both been student athletes at the University of Missouri, as had other members of her family.[1] She achieved a black belt in taekwondo at age six.[2][3] Cunningham attended Rock Bridge High School, starring on the girls' basketball and volleyball teams. When the kicker on the football team had their season ended with an ACL tear, Cunningham joined the football team as their kicker as well, going two for four on FG attempts.[4][5][6] College career[edit] Cunningham played four seasons of college basketball at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri for the Tigers.[7] In 129 career starts, Cunningham averaged 17.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 3.0 apg for the Tigers.

Indiana Fever (2025-present)[edit] On January 31, 2025, Cunningham was traded to the Indiana Fever in a four-team trade that also included the Dallas Wings and Connecticut Sun.[10][11][12] Cunningham has earned recognition as the Fever's enforcer after she was ejected from a game against the Connecticut Sun for grabbing Jacy Sheldon and pulling her to the ground in retribution for Sheldon poking teammate Caitlin Clark in the eye earlier in the game.[13][14][15] The incident went viral, leading to a dramatic increase in sales of Cunningham's jersey and hundreds of thousands of new followers on her social media accounts.[16] Analyst career[edit] In December 2022, Cunningham became a recurring analyst for the Phoenix Suns on their Suns Live! pregame, halftime, and post-game TV coverage.[17][18] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[19] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2019 Phoenix 32 5 12.2 .354 .304 .882 1.4 0.8 0.3 0.1 0.6 3.1 2020 Phoenix 21 11 18.9 .385 .235 .880 1.0 0.8 0.5 0.1 0.7 5.0 2021 Phoenix 30 4 17.5 .437 .410 .704 2.0 1.1 0.5 0.2 0.5 5.6 2022 Phoenix 28 20 29.5 .449 .400 .875 4.4 1.6 1.0 0.4 1.0 12.6 2023 Phoenix 31 31 29.0 .413 .337 .875 2.8 2.1 0.6 0.4 1.5 11.3 2024 Phoenix 40 21 27.8 .429 .378 .870 3.9 2.0 1.0 0.3 1.0 8.4 Career 6 years, 1 team 182 92 22.8 .422 .362 .859 2.7 1.4 0.7 0.2 0.9 7.7 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2019 Phoenix 1 0 8.0 1.000 1.000 degrees .000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 2020 Phoenix 2 0 9.5 .500 .333 -- 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5 2.5 2021 Phoenix 8 2 17.5 .484 .565 1.000 2.1 0.8 0.3 0.9 0.8 6.4 2022 Phoenix 2 2 31.0 .455 .375 .333 2.5 2.0 0.5 0.0 2.5 7.5 2024 Phoenix 2 2 31.5 .500 .429 -- 4.5 3.5 1.5 0.5 0.5 6.5 Career 5 years, 1 team 15 6 19.5 .491 .500 .625 2.2 1.1 0.4 0.5 1.0 5.8 College[edit] NCAA statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2015-16 Missouri 32 32 30.1 .502 .356 .831 5.8 3.0 1.1 0.3 2.4 14.0 2016-17 Missouri 31 31 32.9 .482 .379 .848 5.3 3.4 0.9 0.3 3.4 17.5 2017-18 Missouri 31 31 32.7 .542 .457 .836 4.7 3.0 0.8 0.1 3.0 18.5 2018-19 Missouri 35 35 34.3 .481 .403 .839 5.9 2.8 1.2 0.3 2.9 17.8 Career 129 129 32.5 .501 .403 .839 5.4 3.0 1.0 0.3 2.9 17.0 References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Sophie Cunningham.

Within four years, she had become a professional.[5] Dantas played for Ourinhos in 2012, Maranhão in 2013, and Americana in 2013-2015.[6] WNBA[edit] Minnesota Lynx (2014-2015)[edit] Dantas was drafted by the Minnesota Lynx in the First Round of the 2012 WNBA draft - 12th Overall. Dantas was not expected to play in the WNBA until after the 2012 Olympic Games.[7] She was signed by the Lynx on April 2, 2014.[8] Dantas made her WNBA debut on May 16, 2014, gathering 12 rebounds in a win against Washington.[9] Dantas became the second rookie in league history to debut with 10 rebounds and 5 assists. With Rebekkah Brunson being sidelined with tendinitis, Dantas became the starter, and soon led the WNBA rookies in rebounds.[10] On August 9, 2015, she made 18 points.[11] Atlanta Dream (2015 and 2017)[edit] On July 27, 2015, Dantas was traded to the Atlanta Dream as part of the three-team deal.[12] She was suspended for the 2016 WNBA season after she failed to report to training camp, instead using the time to train with the Brazilian National team for the 2016 Summer Olympics that the country would host in Rio de Janeiro.[13] Atlanta retained Dantas's rights and they expected her to play with the team during the 2017 season. Minnesota Lynx (2019-2023)[edit] On February 8, 2019, Dantas signed with the Minnesota Lynx as a free agent.[14] Dantas missed several games in 2019 due to a calf injury.[15] In 2019, Dantas started all 26 games she played in and recorded career-highs in minutes, points, and assists per game. She continued to expand her game and make herself valuable for the Lynx as she improved her outside shooting to open up the inside play for Sylvia Fowles.[16] Dantas showed up in 2020 for the Lynx as they played in the WNBA Bubble. Over the 22-game campaign, Dantas shot 44.3% from three-point on just over four attempts beyond the arc per game, cementing her spot as one of the WNBA's elite-shooting bigs. She finished the season with averages of 12.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[17] Dantas and the Lynx agreed to a multi-year extension in September 2020 after she completed one of her best years in the WNBA. Coach Cheryl Reeve stated that, ""Damiris has been such an important part of the Lynx culture since she first became a member of our organization in 2014...She has made great strides as a player over the last couple of years and remains an important element in our path forward."" [18] In one of the final games of the 2021 season, Dantas suffered a Lisfranc injury in her right foot, forcing her to end her season early and undergo surgery.[19] The extensive recovery time led to her developing a depression that led to lesser results and ultimately a nervous breakdown at the fifteenth game of the 2022 season. After discussing with Reeve, the coach agreed Dantas was not mentally well to continue playing, sidelining her to spend time with rest and psychological treatment. Dantas attended the Lynx training camp in 2023, ending up waived. To compensate her absence in the WNBA, Dantas led the Brazilian team to the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup title and played in both Mexico for Fuerza Regia and Turkey for Ormanspor.[20][21] Indiana Fever (2024-present)[edit] On February 1, 2024 Dantas signed a multi-year contract with the Indiana Fever.[22] Dantas had to miss the opening week of training camp due to an issue with her visa and a family emergency. She returned to Indianapolis for the second week of camp, but a knee injury prevented her from training with the team. The Fever suspended her contract while she recovered from her injury.[23] On June 25, 2024, the Fever activated Dantas.[24] WNBA career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 regular season WNBA regular season statistics[25] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2012 Did not play (Olympic commitment) 2013 Did not play 2014 Minnesota 30 23 21.8 .511 1.000 .760 5.1 1.2 0.5 0.3 0.8 6.0 2015 Minnesota 16 4 16.7 .581 .667 .789 3.3 1.2 0.2 0.3 1.1 5.6 Atlanta 16 16 24.8 .383 .333 .973 5.4 0.7 0.9 0.6 1.1 8.3 2016 Did not play (Olympic commitment) 2017 Atlanta 34 2 18.0 .392 .265 .767 3.6 0.7 0.5 0.5 0.8 7.7 2018 Atlanta 19 0 13.4 .433 .238 .722 2.4 0.8 0.4 0.0 0.5 5.4 2019 Minnesota 26 26 25.6 .432 .393 .731 4.5 3.2 0.7 0.5 1.7 9.2 2020 Minnesota 22 22 26.6 .464 .433 .727 6.1 2.6 1.1 0.2 1.8 12.9 2021 Minnesota 24 20 23.8 .377 .333 .650 4.0 2.3 0.4 0.3 1.8 7.7 2022 Minnesota 15 15 17.5 .304 .262 .833 3.8 1.9 0.2 0.1 1.1 5.1 2023 Did not play 2024 Indiana 20 0 10.5 .459 .394 .667 2.2 0.6 0.3 0.3 0.6 4.5 Career 9 years, 3 teams 222 128 20.2 .426 .345 .776 4.1 1.5 0.5 0.3 1.1 7.4 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2014 Minnesota 3 0 8.4 .500 -- -- 0.7 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.7 2019 Minnesota 1 1 28.0 .615 .333 1.000 6.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 5.0 degrees 20.0 2020 Minnesota 4 4 34.3 .471 .519 .833 7.5 2.8 1.5 0.0 2.5 18.0 2024 Indiana 2 0 16.0 .500 .400 1.000 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5 8.0 Career 4 years, 2 teams 10 5 22.2 .500 .474 .875 4.0 1.4 0.8 0.0 1.7 11.0 References[edit] External links[edit] Career statistics from WNBA.com · Basketball Reference Media related to Damiris Dantas at Wikimedia Commons Portals: Biography Brazil Olympic Games Basketball Sports Retrieved from ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damiris_Dantas&oldid=1302308431"""

The 21 point performance was a career high in points. Howard averaged 7.0 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in her rookie season in Indiana.[7] During her second season with Indiana, Howard regressed in both points and rebounding, averaging 4.2 points and 2.6 rebounds. The only times that Howard scored in double figures were an August 4 loss to the Chicago Sky, when she scored 13 points, and on a September 1 win against the Connecticut Sun, when she scored 10 points. During her second season, the Fever reached the WNBA Finals, where they faced off against the Minnesota Lynx. The Fever ultimately lost the series 3-2, but Howard didn't miss a single shot throughout the entire Finals, going 8 for 8 from the floor in five games and 3 for 3 free throws.[8] On February 2, 2016, the Fever traded Howard to the Minnesota Lynx in a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Devereaux Peters.[9] During her first season with the Lynx, Howard was part of the post rotation that included Sylvia Fowles, Rebekkah Brunson, and Janel McCarville. She became a key contributor off the bench for the Lynx the entire season. In her first game against Indiana since the trade, Howard scored 11 points, on 5-5 shooting, and grabbed 3 rebounds. She matched her career high of 21 points in a July 2 win against the San Antonio Stars. Howard, once again, reached the WNBA Finals for a 2nd consecutive season, although the Lynx fell to the Los Angeles Sparks 3 games to 2. In her second season with the Lynx, Howard continued with her bench role, contributing with her scoring and rebounding, helping the Lynx back to championship contention. The Lynx returned to the Finals, making it Howard's third appearance in the finals. This time, in a finals rematch against the Sparks, the Lynx won 3 games to 2, earning Howard her first championship. On February 7, 2018, Howard was traded to the Seattle Storm in exchange for a second round pick in the 2018 WNBA draft.[10] In the 2018 season, Howard would be the starting power forward for the Storm. She would have the best season of her career in Seattle as she averaged career-highs in scoring, blocks, rebounds, assists and steals. Howard would also be named to the WNBA All-Defensive First Team and was second in the league in blocks. The Storm finished with a league-best 26-8 record. They would receive a double-bye to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals series, the Storm would defeat the Phoenix Mercury in five games advancing to the Finals, making this Howard's fourth consecutive finals appearance. In the Finals, the Storm would defeat the Washington Mystics in a three-game sweep. In Game 3, Howard scored a new career-high 29 points along with 14 rebounds.[11] In 2019, Howard would have a breakout season. She would be voted into the 2019 WNBA All-Star Game, making it her first all-star appearance. On July 17, 2019, Howard scored a new career-high 33 points in a 90-79 victory over the Minnesota Lynx.[12] Howard would finish the season average a new career-high in scoring, rebounds, assists and steals.

The Storm finished as the number 6 seed with an 18-16 record. The Storm, however, could not defend their title in the playoffs as they were eliminated in the second-round elimination game by the Los Angeles Sparks. In 2020, the season was delayed and shortened to 22 games in a bubble at IMG Academy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Howard played all 22 games, the Storm had a fully active roster with everyone healthy and available as they finished the season 18-4 with the number 2 seed, receiving a double-bye to the semi-finals. In the playoff semi-finals they defeated the Minnesota Lynx in a three-game sweep, going back to the Finals for the second time in three years. In the Finals, the Storm swept the Las Vegas Aces to win the series, earning Howard her third WNBA championship. In 2021, Howard was acquired by the New York Liberty in a three-team trade deal.[13] In January 2023, Howard was traded to the Dallas Wings in a three-team deal.[14] Howard signed a one-year $214,666 contract with the Indiana Fever as a free agent on February 2, 2025.[15][16][17] Bringing Howard back to Indiana was one of the priorities for the Fever's front office, which had been completely restructured after the 2024 season.[18] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader † Denotes seasons in which Howard won a WNBA championship Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[19] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2014 Indiana 34 15 17.0 .443 .000 .594 3.1 0.6 0.8 0.6 1.5 7.0 2015 Indiana 30 2 11.4 .379 .000 .721 2.6 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.9 4.2 2016 Minnesota 34 1 14.6 .574 .200 .677 3.6 0.8 0.7 0.7 1.1 6.7 2017† Minnesota 34 0 11.7 .484 .214 .733 2.4 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.7 4.3 2018† Seattle 34 33 25.6 .547 .327 .798 6.4 1.0 1.2 1.9 1.8 13.2 2019 Seattle 34 34 31.3 .439 .308 .810 8.2 2.1 2.2 1.7 2.9 18.1 2020† Seattle 22 22 21.0 .530 .350 .778 7.1 1.0 1.7 0.6 2.1 9.5 2021 New York 13 13 27.5 .494 .333 .774 7.2 1.7 1.3 0.5 3.8 16.2 2022 New York 35 35 29.9 .482 .326 .715 7.3 2.3 1.3 1.0 3.2 15.1 2023 Dallas 39 39 33.1 .458 .299 .815 8.0 2.6 1.3 1.2 2.8 16.5 2024 Dallas 27 26 30.6 .456 .200 .718 6.7 2.9 1.3 0.8 3.1 17.6 Career 11 years, 5 teams 336 220 23.0 .476 .297 .750 5.6 1.5 1.1 1.0 2.1 11.5 All-Star 2 1 19.0 .529 .500 -- 4.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 11.0 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2014 Indiana 4 0 3.7 .167 .000 1.000 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 2015 Indiana 9 0 7.1 .917 .000 1.000 0.6 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.5 2.8 2016 Minnesota 8 0 13.0 .700 .000 .429 2.6 0.6 0.8 0.1 0.7 5.6 2017† Minnesota 7 0 5.6 .200 .000 .800 0.9 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.5 1.1 2018† Seattle 8 8 31.5 .573 .500 .850 8.3 1.5 1.0 1.3 2.2 15.8 2019 Seattle 2 2 28.8 .400 .429 .750 9.0 4.0 2.0 1.5 2.0 11.0 2020† Seattle 6 6 23.0 .548 .500 .772 5.2 1.5 1.2 0.8 1.5 9.5 2021 New York 1 1 31.0 .438 .500 .000 10.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 3.0 16.0 2022 New York 3 3 27.7 .442 .100 1.000 6.7 1.0 0.7 0.0 2.0 14.7 2023 Dallas 5 5 34.2 .634 .350 .833 8.4 2.2 1.6 1.4 3.4 12.0 Career 10 years, 5 teams 53 25 18.0 .500 .371 .794 4.2 1.0 0.8 0.5 1.4 7.7 College[edit] NCAA statistics[20] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2010-11 Florida State 32 32 25.5 .460 .368 .549 6.6 0.8 1.1 0.7 3.1 10.6 2011-12 31 31 30.2 .487 .190 .615 9.1 1.4 1.5 1.3 3.1 12.2 2012-13 33 31 26.8 .486 .000 .612 7.5 0.7 1.8 1.5 2.4 12.7 2013-14 33 33 31.2 .594 -- .650 9.3 0.5 2.1 2.3 2.7 20.5 Career 129 127 28.4 .516 .313 .617 8.1 0.9 1.6 1.4 2.8 14.0 Personal life[edit] Howard is married to Jac'Eil Duckworth Howard, and their wedding was shown as part of the 11th season of Basketball Wives.[21][22] References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Natasha Howard (basketball).

She was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team after averaging 9.8 points on the season, third on the team behind Kelsey Plum and Chantel Osahor.[3] McDonald announced that she would leave the program and transfer after one season.[4] She cited departures of Plum, Osahor, head coach Mike Neighbors, assistant coach Morgan Valley, and the passing of her grandfather as reasons for her transfer.[5] University of Arizona[edit] McDonald decided to transfer to play at Arizona for Adia Barnes, a former Washington assistant who was heavily involved in recruiting her to play for the Huskies.[6][7] She spent her first season with the program sitting out due to transfer rules and was a member of the scout team.[8] Redshirt sophomore year[edit] McDonald made an immediate impact in her first year on the court for the Wildcats, tying the school's single game scoring record with 39 points against Loyola Marymount in the second game of the season.[9] She finished the season with 890 points scored, breaking a single-season record set by her coach Barnes, and was the second player in Pac-12 history to have 800 points and 150 assists, joining her former teammate Plum.[5] She was named to the All-Pac-12 first team and defensive team at the end of the season.[10] Redshirt junior year[edit] After tying the single-game record for scoring in the previous season, McDonald broke the record with a 44-point performance against 22nd-ranked Texas on November 17, 2019.[11] McDonald racked up awards, being named a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and United States Basketball Writers Association, a first-team All-American by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, first-team All-Pac-12 and on the Pac-12 All-Defensive team.[12] She was also a finalist for the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year Award and named the 2020 recipient of the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award, given to the top shooting guard in the country.[13][14] Although she was eligible for the WNBA draft, McDonald announced that she would return for her senior season at Arizona.[15][16] Redshirt senior year[edit] McDonald was named the Pac-12 Conference Player of the Year, becoming the first Arizona player to win the award since her head coach Adia Barnes.[17] She was also named the Co-Defensive Player of the Year, the second consecutive year she was named the winner. McDonald excelled during Arizona's 2021 NCAA tournament run. After leading the Wildcats past Stony Brook and BYU, she scored 31 points against Texas A&M in the Sweet Sixteen, sending Arizona to the Elite Eight for the first time.[18] She scored 33 points in the Wildcats' Elite Eight match against Indiana, despite suffering an ankle injury with more than two minutes remaining in the game.[19] In their next game against UConn, she scored 26 points en route to earning the first championship appearance in program history, as well as praise from UConn head coach Geno Auriemma.[20] In the national championship game, McDonald scored a game-high 22 points and was able to get the final shot of the game off, but could not get it to fall as the Wildcats lost to Stanford 54-53, ending their historic run.[21] She ended her college career after scoring double-digits in 93 consecutive games, which was the longest active streak.

She is widely considered one of the greatest three-point shooters in the WNBA. She is a four-time WNBA All-Star and All-WNBA Team selection, and an Olympic gold medalist with the United States national team. Ionescu played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks, where she twice won the John R. Wooden Award and Wade Trophy, earning consensus national player of the year honors as a senior. She set the Division I career triple-doubles record and is the Pac-12 Conference all-time leader in assists. Regarded as one of the greatest collegiate players in history, Ionescu was selected first overall by the New York Liberty in the 2020 WNBA draft. In 2023, she broke the WNBA single-season record in three-pointers and the WNBA Three-Point Contest record. She led the Liberty to their first league championship in the following year. Early life[edit] Ionescu was born in Walnut Creek, California, to Romanian-American parents. Her father, Dan Ionescu, escaped communist Romania around the time of the 1989 revolution, seeking political asylum in the United States. He hoped that his then-wife, Liliana Blaj, and their son Andrei could join them in a few months, but they were unable to move to the US until 1995.[2] By that time, Dan owned a limousine service in Northern California, where he had chosen to settle because he had several extended family members in that area.[2] Sabrina was around three years old when she first picked up a basketball. She has a twin brother Edward (""Eddy""), who was born 18 minutes after her.[3][4] Eddy played basketball at the City College of San Francisco before transferring to Oregon; he was solely a student in the 2018-19 school year[5] before walking on to the Ducks men's basketball team in 2019-20. Sabrina Ionescu grew up in a Romanian-speaking household.[6][7] In a 2019 interview with Ava Wallace of The Washington Post, Ionescu admitted to being a ""natural scorer"", but said that most of the rest of her skill set came from playing alongside both boys and older girls in her childhood:[8]When I was younger, I was always playing with the guys, and I had to find ways to get the ball, because they never wanted to pass to me. So I figured that if I could rebound, I would be able to get the ball myself. Then passing-wise, when I was in sixth grade playing with the eighth-grade team, I was obviously a lot shorter, skinnier, smaller than they were. I would just have to find ways to impact the game other than shooting or scoring, and that was passing. Ionescu attended a middle school that did not have enough players to field a girls' team, and her school refused to allow her to play on the boys' team. She recalled, ""My middle school said I should be playing with dolls. Seriously, word-for-word."" She responded by recruiting enough girls to enable her school to have a team.[8] High school[edit] Sabrina Ionescu as MVP of the 2016 McDonald's All-American Girls Game Ionescu was a four-year varsity basketball letter winner at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California under head coach Kelly Sopak.[9] As a freshman in 2012-13, she started 14 of 29 games and averaged 13.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.9 steals per game to help her team to a 27-3 record and a Northern California Section Division II runner-up finish. As a sophomore in 2013-14, Ionescu helped her team to a 30-2 record.[10] During her junior year, Ionescu averaged 18.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 4.7 steals per game, and helped Miramonte High School to a 30-2 record with an appearance in the CIF open division semifinals. In her senior year, she led Miramonte to the CIF open division title game after averaging 25.3 points, 8.8 assists, 7.6 rebounds, 4.5 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. She posted a triple-double in the championship game loss to Chaminade with 24 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds.[11] Ionescu also made a first half buzzer-beating shot from half court. She received national honors including the USA Today Girls Basketball Player of the Year, Max Preps Player of the Year, Cal-Hi Sports Ms. Basketball State Player of the Year and Gatorade State Player of the Year.[12] Ionescu was named a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand All-American selection. She was named the McDonald's All-America game MVP after scoring a record 25 points, including seven three-pointers, with 10 rebounds.[13] Ionescu left Miramonte with a career win-loss record of 119-9 and a school-record 2,606 points scored. She is also the all-time leader in assists (769), steals (549) and triple-doubles (21). In addition to the career record, Ionescu also held the Miramonte top three single-season scoring records with 598 (2013-14), 760 (2014-15) and 834 (2015-16). Ionescu also held the single-game scoring record of 43 points vs. Pinewood High School while being double- and triple-teamed and the single-game record in assists with 19 at Dublin High School.[citation needed] Ionescu was the No. 1 ranked point guard and No. 4 overall player in the recruiting class of 2016.[14] According to Ava Wallace of The Washington Post, Ionescu chose Oregon ""because she wanted to be the all-American at Oregon, not just an all-American somewhere else."" At the time, she was the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to Oregon basketball.[8] However, she had difficulty making a college choice, not signing a National Letter of Intent with any school during either the early signing period in November 2015 or the late period in April 2016. Ionescu finally committed to Oregon just before the school's 2016 summer term began, driving with her father for 8 hours from their Bay Area home to Eugene, making an unannounced visit to Matthew Knight Arena and telling head coach Kelly Graves that she would join the team.[2] College career[edit] Freshman season[edit] On November 13, 2016, Ionescu made her collegiate debut for Oregon, recording 11 points in an 84-67 win over Lamar. Ionescu recorded four triple-doubles, one shy of the Pac-12 record and two less than the NCAA record. She averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, ranking second on the team in scoring and rebounding, and first in assists. She also posted seven double-doubles, ranked third in the Pac-12 and 29th in the NCAA with 183 assists on the year. Her 1.93-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was second-best in the Pac-12. She was named Pac-12 Freshman of Week four times and was named USBWA National Player of the Week. At the end of the regular season, she was named Pac-12 Freshmen of the Year and unanimous First Team All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 All-Freshman Team selection. Additionally, she was awarded the USBWA National Freshman of the Year presented by the United States Basketball Writers Association.[15] Sophomore season[edit] Ionescu rose to national prominence in her sophomore year, leading the Ducks to their third regular-season league crown all-time and first-ever No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Women's Basketball Tournament. She led the Pac-12 in scoring (19.2) and assists, dishing out 7.8 assists per game which was fifth-most in the country. She had 16 double-doubles this season and 14 20-point games. She recorded 10-assist games 13 times this season, handing out a league season-high 14 twice. On February 26, 2018, Ionescu was named ESPNW's college basketball player of the week.[16] Following her second season, she was named the Pac-12 Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year, and was also named a first team All-American by ESPN. Oregon also won the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2000. She was named the winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top Division I women's point guard after the season,[17] and was also a finalist for the Naismith Award.[18] Ionescu became the NCAA women's all-time leader in triple-doubles,[19] trailing only former BYU men's player Kyle Collinsworth (with 12) among all NCAA players.[20] Junior season[edit] Sabrina Ionescu at the 2019 Pac-12 Tournament. On November 6, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 11th triple-double in a victory against Alaska-Fairbanks.[21] Twelve days later, she would tie the NCAA triple-double record, with her 12th triple-double in a win against Buffalo.[22] On December 20, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 13th triple-double in a game against Air Force and broke the NCAA triple-double record for both men's and women's basketball.[23][24] She was later named ESPNW Player of the Week.[25] Since that game, Ionescu added five more triple-doubles for a season total of eighteen and broke the Oregon women's basketball assist record (formerly 608 assists) in a Pac-12 conference game against USC.[26][27][28] In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Ionescu led the Ducks to their first Final Four appearance after a 88-84 victory over Mississippi State.[29] Ionescu finished the game with 31 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and a steal. In the Final Four, the Ducks lost to the eventual national champion Baylor 72-67. Ionescu won John R. Wooden Award and the Wade Trophy as the best women's college basketball player in NCAA Division I. Despite having only played for three seasons, Ionescu was eligible for the 2019 WNBA draft by age. Additionally, she would receive her bachelor's degree that June.[30] However, believing that she had ""unfinished business"" at Oregon, she chose to come back for her senior season.[31] This announcement came shortly after Ionescu accepted a place in a newly launched one-year master's degree program in brand creation in Oregon's School of Journalism and Communications.[32] Senior season[edit] In the second game of her senior season on November 13, 2019, Ionescu surpassed the 2,000 points, 800 assists mark for her college career with a 109-52 win over Utah State. She fell short of another triple-double with 16 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds in the game but recorded her 2,012th career point and 810th career assist.[33] In a win over then #3 Stanford (87-55), Ionescu scored a career high 37 points along with 11 rebounds and 7 assists, and broke Alison Lang's Oregon all-time career scoring record of 2,252 points in the third quarter.[34][35] In the rivalry game against Oregon State on January 24, 2020, Ionescu had 24 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds and broke Oregon State and NBA star Gary Payton's Pac-12 all-time record of 938 assists.[36][37] Payton personally congratulated Ionescu on the achievement.[38] On February 14, 2020, Ionescu recorded her 1,000th career assist in a game against #7 UCLA and joined Courtney Vandersloot as the only players in NCAA men's and women's basketball history with 2,000 plus points and 1,000 plus assists.[39] Ten days later in the Ducks' 74-66 win at #4 Stanford, she became the first NCAA player ever with 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. Ionescu also recorded her eighth triple-double of the season, tying her own NCAA single-season record from the previous season. Earlier that day, she had been a featured speaker at the memorial service for Kobe Bryant[40], who had become a close personal friend within the previous two years, flying from Los Angeles to the Bay Area immediately after her speech.[41] On April 14, 2020, Ionescu was named the winner of the Honda Sports Award as the best collegiate female basketball player in the nation.[42][43] Ionescu won the AP Player of the Year, Naismith College Player of the Year, USBWA National Player of the Year and the John R. Wooden Award and the Wade Trophy. Ionescu received the Nancy Lieberman award for her third straight season. Impact at Oregon[edit] According to Ducks coach Kelly Graves, in 2019 Ionescu had ""a chance to be a Marcus Mariota, that level of player and an esteemed Oregon Duck when it's all said and done."" He noted that attendance at Oregon women's games had dramatically increased during Ionescu's career at the school. In the season before she arrived, the average announced home attendance for the Ducks was 1,501. Her sophomore season saw an average attendance of over 4,200; it went up to over 7,100 in her junior season and over 10,000 in her senior season.[30] Ionescu was also a significant draw when Oregon went on the road; for example, when the Ducks visited Washington during her junior season, the crowd for that game was 3,000 more than the Huskies drew two nights earlier against Oregon State.[8] Graves' remarks about Ionescu's future iconic status at Oregon proved to be prophetic. Shortly after the premature end of her senior season (caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), the university polled fans on social media, asking them to name the four Oregon alumni they would put on a national Mount Rushmore for the university. According to a 2020 story in the university's web journal Around the O, more than 70 suggestions were provided, but the four top choices were Mariota, Steve Prefontaine, Phil Knight, and Ionescu. As the story's author Damian Foley put it,Yes, Sabrina Elaine Ionescu, who only earned her diploma in 2019, is considered by UO fans to be one of the four greatest Ducks ever, standing alongside such greats as Marcus Mariota, Steve Prefontaine, and the alumnus who co-founded Nike and made the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact possible.[30] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] New York Liberty (2020-present)[edit] Ionescu with the New York Liberty in 2022 Ionescu turned 22 in December 2019, making her eligible to declare for the 2019 WNBA draft. A January 2019 mock draft by ESPN, incorporating input from WNBA personnel and ESPN women's basketball analysts, concluded that Ionescu was a possible top pick should she declare.[44] However, Ionescu announced in an open letter published in The Players' Tribune on April 6, 2019, the day after Oregon's loss to Baylor in the Final Four and four days before the draft, that she would return to Oregon for her senior season.[31] On April 17, 2020, the New York Liberty selected Ionescu with the first overall pick in the 2020 WNBA draft.[45] She played her first game with the Liberty on July 25. In her second WNBA game on July 29 against the Dallas Wings, she recorded 33 points, 7 assists, and 7 rebounds in 34 minutes of play.[46] On August 1, 2020, Ionescu injured her left ankle in the second quarter against the Atlanta Dream. She was diagnosed the next day with a[47] grade 3 sprain, and was expected to miss about one month while recovering.[48][49] In the end, though, she did not play again for the remainder of her first professional season.[47] She complained about not being able to be considered a rookie in her second season of playing in the WNBA even though she played two games in her first season.[50] Sabrina Ionescu on the court for the NY Liberty, September 29, 2024 The next season, on May 18, 2021, Ionescu recorded her first professional triple-double in her 6th career game. She scored 26 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds, she became the fastest player in WNBA history to record a triple double.[51] It was also the first Liberty triple-double, as well as the tenth in league history.[52] On July 6, 2022, Ionescu had 31 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists to record the first 30-point triple-double in WNBA history.[53] Ionecscu and the Liberty advanced to the WNBA Finals in consecutive seasons (2023 and 2024). They were defeated by the Las Vegas Aces in 2023, 3 games to 1.[54] The following season, they matched up against the Minnesota Lynx.

Neither was it a good individual season for Johannès who was for the first time not nominated in the All-LFB First Team since the creation of the award and having her stats going slightly down, including her shooting percentage in LFB going from 49.2% the previous season to 41.8%.[5] Galatasaray[edit] On June 27, 2025, she signed with Galatasaray of the Turkish Women's Basketball Super League (TKBL).[19] WNBA[edit] Johannes went undrafted in the 2017 WNBA draft.

In February 2020, it was announced that she signed a multi-year deal with the Liberty.[21] However, because of the COVID pandemic, she opted not to play during the 2020 season[22] and the Liberty suspended her contract for the year.[23] She didn't play the 2021 season either because of overseas commitment, having both the EuroBasket and the Olympic Games to play that summer. On 8 June 2022, the Liberty announced that she would join the team for the 2022 season.[24] She improved her career high in points by scoring 23 points in a loss against the Seattle Storm on 20 June 2022.[25] In March 2023, Johannès re-signed with the Liberty.[26] Johannès did not play in the 2024 WNBA season, focusing on the 2024 Olympic Games.[27] On 21 March 2025, Liberty announced that they had re-signed Johannès for the 2025 season.[28] National team career[edit] This section needs expansion.

She also served as an assistant coach for Sacramento State. She played college basketball at Oregon. She represented Germany at the 2018 FIBA U18 Women's European Championship and won a gold medal. She also represented Germany at the 2024 Summer Olympics. College career[edit] On 7 November 2017, Sabally signed with Oregon.[2] During the 2018-19 season in her freshman year, she sat out the season after suffering a torn ACL during the championship game of the 2018 FIBA U18 Women's European Championship in August 2018.[3] During the 2019-20 season in her redshirt freshman year, she re-tore her ACL in the summer of 2019 and missed a second consecutive season.[4] During the 2020-21 season in her redshirt sophomore year, she played in 23 of Oregon's 24 games, making 21 starts. She led Oregon in scoring (12.9), rebounding (7.3), field goals (122), double-doubles (4) and double-figure scoring games (19). She ranked third in the Pac-12 in field-goal percentage (54.7), third in offensive rebounding (2.7), fourth in rebounding and tenth in scoring.[3] Following the season she was named to the All-Pac-12 team.[5] During the 2021-22 season in her redshirt junior year, she led the team in scoring and rebounding and finished sixth in the conference in scoring (15.4) and third in rebounding (7.8). She recorded eight double-doubles, and reached double figures in scoring in 19 of the 24 games. She became the first Pac-12 player since Chiney Ogwumike in 2013 to average at least 15 points, seven rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.3 steals and blocks over the course of a season.[3] Following the season she was again named to the All-Pac-12 team.[6] On 28 March 2022, Sabally declared for the 2022 WNBA draft. She finished her career at Oregon with 666 points, 354 rebounds and 87 assists in two seasons.[7] Professional career[edit] WNBA[edit] New York Liberty (2023-present)[edit] On 11 April 2022, Sabally was drafted fifth overall by the New York Liberty in the 2022 WNBA draft.[8] On 15 April 2022, Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb announced Sabally would miss the 2022 WNBA season due to injury, after she aggravated her right knee, which has twice required surgery for a torn ACL.[9] On 28 February 2023, Sabally signed a rookie scale contract with the Liberty.[10] She missed the first half of the 2024 WNBA season recovering from a back injury before the Olympics break, where Sabally joined her Liberty teammate Leonie Fiebich on the German national basketball team.[11] During game 5 of the 2024 WNBA Finals against the Minnesota Lynx, she scored 13 points and seven rebounds in 17 minutes off the bench to help the Liberty win their first WNBA championship in franchise history.[12] During the third quarter she scored seven consecutive points for the Liberty, helping them gain their first lead of the game. During overtime she recorded a steal and a layup to extend the Liberty's lead to five points. She also recorded a defensive rebound with 13 seconds remaining in overtime to help secure the win.[13][14][15] The Liberty's star player Breanna Stewart said in the post game press conference that Sabally was ""The X Factor"" for contributing to the team's championship win.[16] On 12 May 2025, the Liberty exercised Sabally's fourth-year rookie option, extending her contract through the 2026 season.[17] Overseas[edit] Sabally played with USK Prague of the Czech Women's Basketball League during the 2023-2024 season.[18] Sabally joined Fenerbahçe of the Turkish Super League in January 2025.[19] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader † Denotes season(s) in which Sabally won a WNBA championship WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current through end of 2024 season WNBA regular season statistics[20] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2023 New York 33 0 7.9 .424 .222 .750 2.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.5 2.3 2024† New York 26 0 13.5 .575 .000 .700 4.0 0.6 0.9 0.7 0.5 4.9 Career 2 years, 1 team 59 0 10.4 .514 .182 .722 3.0 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.5 3.5 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2023 New York 4 0 1.3 -- -- -- 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 2024† New York 9 0 10.1 .542 -- .875 3.4 0.0 0.7 0.7 1.7 4.4 Career 2 years, 1 team 13 0 7.4 .542 -- .875 2.4 0.1 0.5 0.5 1.2 3.1 College[edit] Ratios YEAR Team GP GS MP FG% 3P% FT% RBG APG BPG SPG PPG 2019-20 Oregon 1 0 0.0 -- -- 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2020-21 Oregon 23 21 24.5 .547 .571 .616 7.3 1.8 1.2 1.0 12.9 2021-22 Oregon 24 20 26.6 .527 .534 .725 7.8 1.9 1.4 1.4 15.4 Career 48 41 25.0 .536 .480 .684 7.4 1.8 1.2 1.3 13.9 Ratios Totals YEAR Team GP GS MP FG FGA 3P 3PA FT FTA REB A BK ST PTS 2019-20 Oregon 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2020-21 Oregon 23 21 563 122 223 8 14 45 73 167 42 22 27 297 2021-22 Oregon 24 20 639 139 264 4 11 87 120 187 45 33 34 369 Career 48 41 1202 261 487 12 25 132 193 354 87 60 56 666 Totals Source[21] National team career[edit] Sabally (left) with her Germany national team and New York Liberty teammate Leonie Fiebich in 2024 Sabally made her international debut for Germany at the 2015 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship for Women, where she averaged nine points, 13.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.

She is one of the most accomplished women in basketball history.[5] Stewart is also a founder of the Unrivaled basketball league along with Napheesa Collier.[6] In high school, Stewart was the National Gatorade Player of the Year, the Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, and a McDonald's All-American. She led the University of Connecticut Huskies to four consecutive national championships, was named the Final Four's most outstanding player a record four times, and was a three-time consensus national player of the year. She was the first overall pick in the 2016 WNBA draft[7] and was named the 2016 WNBA Rookie of the Year.[8] She was named the WNBA MVP in 2018[9] and 2023,[10] and was named an All-Star in 2017, 2018, 2021,[11] 2022 and 2023. She led the Storm to two championships in 2018 and 2020, and received the WNBA Finals MVP award both times. In 2021, Stewart was named to The W25 as one of the top 25 players of the WNBA's first 25 years.[12] Stewart is a two-time EuroLeague Women champion and was MVP of the league in 2019, as well as winning national league titles in Russia and Türkiye. As a member of the U.S. women's national team, Stewart has won gold medals in the 2016,[13] 2020, and 2024 Olympics[14] and at the 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIBA World Cups. Early life[edit] Stewart was born Breanna Mackenzie Baldwin in Syracuse, New York, to a single mother, Heather Baldwin. Her biological father was not involved in her life, and her mother worked multiple jobs to support herself and her daughter. When Stewart was a toddler, her mother began dating Brian Stewart, who later adopted Stewart after marrying Baldwin. She has a younger half-brother, Connor.[15][16] Stewart began playing basketball at an early age. Due to her height her coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder, but her father encouraged her to practice ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. She started a daily routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones, for a mile.[17] Her routine improved her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. In a 2017 essay in The Players' Tribune, Stewart publicly revealed that she had been a victim of sexual abuse from age 9 to 11. She reported the abuse to her parents, who immediately called police.[18] The perpetrator, who was married to her maternal aunt, confessed to the abuse and ultimately served prison time.[16][18] High school[edit] Stewart attended Cicero-North Syracuse High School (C-NS) in Cicero, where she played for head coach Eric Smith.[19][20] She was nicknamed ""Bean"" by her teammates, and ""6-10"" because of her wingspan.[21] Stewart first played for the high school team while still in eighth grade. She played as a starter in most games, and averaged nine points, almost nine rebounds and seven blocks per game. In her freshman year, she almost doubled her point production, scoring 17 points per game. That year, her team had a 21-3 record, and made it to the regional final game.[22] In her sophomore year, she was a starter in every game, and upped her scoring average to 22 points per game. In that year, her team's record was 18-4. As a junior, she helped lead her team to the state AA public school title, with a 22-3 record for the year. Stewart averaged 24 points and 15 rebounds for the season.[22] During her junior year, she announced that she would be attending the University of Connecticut. The day after the announcement, she dunked the ball in a game against Baldwinsville, her first career dunk.[23][24] Stewart achieved a milestone on January 31, 2012, when she scored her 2,000th point, as part of a 31-0 run against Auburn.[25] Stewart was selected as a member of the 2012 McDonald's All-American team, which represented the 24 best female high school basketball players. The selected players were grouped into two squads that competed in the annual McDonald's All-American Game, held that year in Chicago.[26] Stewart was selected to the 2012 Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) High School Coaches' All-America Team. The top 20 high school players in the country were named as WBCA All-Americans and were eligible to play in the all-star game. She participated in the 2012 WBCA High School All-America Game, scoring 10 points.[27][28] Stewart was named the 2012 Naismith High School Girls' Player of the Year, the honor awarded by the Atlanta Tipoff Club to the best female high school basketball player in the country.[29][30] In March 2012, in a surprise presentation by Tamika Catchings, Stewart received the Gatorade National Girls Basketball Player of the Year award.[31][32] Stewart was one of six finalists for the Gatorade High School Athlete of the Year.[33] High school tournaments[edit] In addition to regularly scheduled post-season tournaments, the success of her high school team led to invitations to prominent national tournaments. In 2010, the C-NS team traveled to Philadelphia, New Jersey and Disney World;[34] in 2011, the team went to the Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix, Arizona, considered the ""premier showcase of all high school girls tournaments"";[34][35] and in 2012, the Northstars played in a Basketball Hall of Fame Tournament in Springfield, Massachusetts.[34][36] Tournament of Champions[edit] Breanna Stewart at the 2012 Hoophall Classic The Tournament of Champions is an annual event, since 1997, showcasing the best high school girls basketball teams.[37] The 2011 event, held in Phoenix, Arizona, included 96 of the best basketball programs in the country.[35] The C-NS team was assigned to the Smith Division, where they faced Bolingbrook High School, considered to be the number 1 team by USA Today.[38] Despite being viewed as a 30-point underdog, Stewart helped her team to the first round upset, scoring 15 points in a 43-40 win.[39][40] In the quarter-final game, Stewart scored 29 points and had 19 rebounds to help the team beat the number 22 ranked team in the country, Dr. Phillips High School from Orlando, Florida. Although double-teamed, she scored ten points in a 12-0 run that gave C-NS a commanding 23-point lead early in the fourth quarter.[41] That win secured a place in the semi-finals of the division. In the semi-final game, C-NS faced St. Mary's, the number 2 ranked team in the country. Stewart had 33 points and 16 rebounds, but it was not enough to overcome the scoring of the eventual champion of the tournament.[42] Although the team lost that game, Stewart's overall performance earned her the most outstanding player of the tournament honors.[43] Stewart was viewed as an offensive threat in the low post, high post and perimeter, and was effective as a defender because of her long wingspan.[44] 2012 Hoophall Classic[edit] Stewart's Northstars team were invited to play in the annual Hoophall Classic; the event was held in Springfield, Massachusetts, and typically featured some of the best high school teams in the country. Their opponents were the local West Springfield team, not nationally ranked, but 8-0 at the time of the meeting. The result was not close, as C-NS beat West Springfield 60-20, with Stewart alone scoring more points than the opposition. Stewart ended the game with 22 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks, despite leaving the game in the third period and not returning. Her performance earned her the Most Outstanding Player award for the event.[36][45][46] College career[edit] Stewart was recruited by many schools, but after a campus visit to UConn in 2011, she told the coaching staff, ""I would like to commit if you'd take me.""[47] Stewart signed her commitment letter on the hood of her car, then gave it to her father at his office to fax to the school.[47] Freshman year[edit] Stewart started her freshman year in strong form, scoring at least 20 points in three of her first four games. She scored a total of 169 points in her first ten games, which broke Maya Moore's record for most points in a player's first 10 career games.[48] However, her output slowed, and her scoring average dropped below ten points for her last eighteen regular season games.[49] In March 2013, she started early morning sessions with Chris Dailey, associate head coach, to concentrate on shooting and post moves.[50] She came back strong in the Big East tournament, with a total of 51 points, matching the number scored by Diana Taurasi in her tournament debut. Her strong performance continued in the NCAA tournament.[49] She did not play in the first round, due to a calf injury, but scored 105 points in the last five games, earning her the award of the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, the first freshman to win the award since 1987.[51] Sophomore year[edit] Stewart receiving the Wade Trophy in 2015. Stewart continued her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches noticed that she was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally did as a freshman, but usually only if she thought she was playing well.[17] By the end of her sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, which she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history it went to a sophomore.[52] Stewart started and played in all[53] 40 games of 2013-2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per game, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn history. Her 324 rebounds marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 blocks was the third-highest mark.[54] Junior year[edit] Stewart earned American Athletic Conference Player of the Year honors for the second straight year in 2014-15, marking the fifth time a Husky was selected as the conference player of the year multiple times. She elevated nearly every aspect of her game during UConn's nine-game run through the postseason, averaging 18.1 points on 53.3 percent shooting to go along with 10.7 rebounds, and made 42.1 percent (8-19) of her attempts from beyond the 3-point arc during postseason action. She entered her senior year in 11th place on UConn's all-time scoring list with 1,960 career points, only 30 points behind Renee Montgomery's 10th-place total. She entered 2015-16 in fifth place on UConn's all-time blocked shots list with 288 career rejections and finished the season with 856 career rebounds, which is the 10th-highest total in UConn history.[citation needed] Senior year[edit] In her final season at UConn, Stewart posted career highs in rebounds (8.7 rpg), assists (4.0 apg) and blocks (126) while shooting 57.9 percent from the floor, sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her third straight Naismith College Player of the Year award, Wade Trophy, Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award; she was also voted American Athletic Player of the Year (third time) and a third straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls. She was the first-ever unanimous pick for AP Player of the Year and the first-ever three-time AP Player of the Year. In leading UConn to another national championship, she was part of the first four-time national championship class in NCAA history and also became the first player to be named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player four times. In her college career Stewart won 151 games and lost 5, which included four straight national championships. She is the first NCAA basketball player ever to tally 400 assists and block 400 shots. She was one of only six Huskies with at least 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. Stewart finished her career second on UConn's all-time scoring list at 2,676 career points, fourth with 1,179 career rebounds, and first in blocks (414).[citation needed] Professional career[edit] Stewart's professional career has been split by summer stints in the WNBA where she has collected three titles, as well as in China, Russia, Türkiye while gaining two EuroLeague championships. WNBA[edit] Seattle Storm[edit] Stewart with the Seattle Storm in 2017 Stewart was drafted first overall in the 2016 WNBA draft by the Seattle Storm. She would play alongside superstar veteran point guard Sue Bird. Stewart immediately made an impact in the league as she scored 23 points in her debut game against the Los Angeles Sparks.[55] As the season progressed, Stewart continued to dominate offensively as she scored a career-high 38 points in a win against the Atlanta Dream, which is the second most points scored in a game in franchise history, behind Lauren Jackson's 47 points.[56] Stewart averaged 18.3 points per game, 9.3 rebounds per game and 1.8 blocks per game by the end of the 2016 season. She swept the Rookie of the Month awards for the entire season leading up to her winning the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award by a landslide.[57] Stewart also broke the WNBA record for most defensive rebounds in a season with 277 defensive rebounds (surpassing Lisa Leslie's record in 2004).[58] Despite the record, Stewart didn't win the rebounding title, sharing the top spot with Tina Charles for most rebounds, who led the league in rebounds per game average. Her season performance helped lead the Storm back to the playoffs for the first time in 3 years with the number 7 seed in the league, but lost in the first round elimination game to the Atlanta Dream. Stewart won the 2016 ESPY Award for Best Female Athlete. The other nominees were Elena Delle Donne, Katie Ledecky, and Simone Biles. She also won Best Women's College Basketball Player at the 2016 ESPYs.[59] In 2017, Stewart continued to flourish after an impressive rookie season. She was voted into the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game, making it her first career all-star game appearance. On August 5, 2017, Stewart scored a season-high 32 points in an 87-80 overtime loss to the San Antonio Stars.[60] Stewart would finish the season with a career-high of 19.9 points per game as the Storm finished with the number 8 seed in the league, but were once again a first-round exit as they were eliminated by the Phoenix Mercury.[citation needed] Breanna Stewart poses with the Activist and Former NFL Quarterback Colin Kaepernick after a WNBA Playoffs game at the Barclays Center on October 1, 2024 In 2018, Stewart would elevate her play to a superstar level. She was voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game for her second all-star game appearance. On August 6, 2018, Stewart scored a season-high 32 points in a 96-80 victory over the New York Liberty, making it her fourth 30-point game of the season.[61] By the end of the season, Stewart was ranked second in the league in scoring, she averaged new career-highs in scoring, steals, field goal percentage and three-point percentage. Stewart would also win the MVP award. This helped the Storm to a 26-8 record with the number 1 seed in the league, receiving a double-bye to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, Stewart started off the series strong with a 28-point performance along with a career-high 6 three-pointers in a 91-87 victory against the Phoenix Mercury in Game 1. The Storm would end up winning the series in five games, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2010. In the Finals, the Storm would defeat the Washington Mystics in a three-game sweep, winning their first championship in 8 years. Stewart averaged 25.7 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.7 steals during the series. Stewart won Finals MVP, becoming the sixth player in league history to win both league MVP and Finals MVP in the same year.[62][63] Stewart missed the entire 2019 WNBA season after suffering an injury while playing for Russian club Dynamo Kursk in the 2019 EuroLeague Women final on April 14 that was later confirmed to be a torn Achilles.[64] She returned to the U.S. the day after the injury and underwent surgery in Los Angeles later that week.[65] Because the WNBA currently lacks any kind of inactive list, the Storm suspended Stewart in order to free up a roster spot. Shortly thereafter, the league made her a paid ambassador for the 2019 season, making her the first active player to fill such a role. Stewart earned slightly more in that role than she would have as a player.[66] In July 2020, Stewart returned to playing, rejoining her teammates at the IMG Academy for training. She won her second title with the Storm in 2020 and was named the 2020 WNBA Finals MVP.[67] In 2020 Sports Illustrated named her one of its Sportspeople of the Year for her activism off the court.[68] During the WNBA's 25th season in 2021, Stewart was named to The W25 as one of the top 25 players in league history.[69] New York Liberty[edit] On February 1, 2023, Stewart signed with the New York Liberty in free agency.[70] In the debut home opener on May 21, 2023, against the Indiana Fever, Stewart scored 45 points and set a new franchise record for most points scored in a game by a single player, set a franchise record for most made field goals at 15, and set a career high in scoring as well as three-pointers made.[71] In her first season with the Liberty, Stewart averaged 23 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.57 blocked shots and 1.45 steals in 34.1 minutes in 40 games. MVP voters awarded Stewart as the 2023 Kia WNBA Most Valuable Player, making Stewart the eighth player in WNBA history to win the award more than once.[72] The Liberty were the second seed heading into the 2023 WNBA playoffs and made it to the championship final round, falling short in game 4 to the Las Vegas Aces in a 70-69 loss.[73] Stewart finished the 2023 postseason averaging 18.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.9 blocks over 10 games.[74] On October 20, 2024, the New York Liberty won its first-ever WNBA Championship in franchise history when it defeated the Minnesota Lynx in a 3-2 Finals series.[75] Stewart finished the 2024 postseason averaging 19.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.9 blocks over 11 games.[76] The Liberty's Finals victory made Stewart's third WNBA Championship.[77] Overseas[edit] For her first full rookie season, Stewart signed with Shanghai Baoshan Dahua of the WCBA for the 2016-17 Chinese campaign.[78] In 2017, Stewart re-signed with Shanghai for the 2017-18 WCBA season.[79] In June 2018, Stewart made a move to Europe and signed with Dynamo Kursk of the Russian Premier League.[80] Here, she was named MVP of EuroLeague Women for the first time.[64] In February 2020, Stewart returned to Russia to sign with UMMC Ekaterinburg for the remainder of the regular season.[81] Re-signing there the following campaign, Stewart won her first EuroLeague championship with Ekat, as well as being named MVP of the 2021 Final Four with averages of 14.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game in the season-ending tournament.[82] She also claimed the Russian Premier League title.

She scored the first basket in league history.[86] National team career[edit] U16[edit] Stewart was selected to join the USA Basketball U16 team, at age 14, the youngest member of the team; all other team members were 15 or 16.[87] Initially, her parents turned down the invitation to join the team, worried about the amount of time she would be missing school. However, Mike Flynn, director of a prominent Amateur Athletic Union team, persuaded her parents that the invitation was an honor, so they relented.[88] At the time, she stood six feet, three inches, the same height as Kiah Stokes and Elizabeth Williams. Despite being the youngest, she earned the starting role for all five games, scoring just under ten points per game, tying Elizabeth Williams for the team lead in blocks. Stewart helped the team win the gold medal in the First FIBA Americas U16 Championship for Women, held in Mexico City. The win secured an automatic bid to the 2010 FIBA U17 World Championship, held in Rodez and Toulouse, France.[87] U17[edit] Stewart continued with the USA team as it became the U17 team. The USA team won all eight games and the gold medal in the 2010 FIBA U17 World Championship for Women. Stewart earned a starting role in all eight games. In the first game, against the host team from France, she led all scorers with 13 points. In the final preliminary game against Japan, she led all scorers with 30 points. In the tournament, she averaged 12.8 points per game, second only to Elizabeth Williams at 13.5 points per game. Stewart was the team leader with 18 blocks.[89] U19[edit] Ariel Massengale and Breanna Stewart, two of the five players named to the five-member All-FIBA U19 World Championship team In 2011, Stewart was selected to be on the USA Basketball U19 team.[90] The U18 team won the 2010 Americas Championship, thus earning an automatic bid to the U19 World Championship, held in Puerto Montt, Chile. The USA won their first five games, but then came up short, losing to Canada 64-52. They were still qualified for the medal round, and played against France in the quarter-final; the USA was down by 13 points early in the game, but took a lead with just over a minute to go in the game and won 70-64. The USA took an early lead in the semi-final against Brazil, and qualified for the gold medal game. The final was against Spain, which the USA won 69-46. Although she was one of the youngest players on the team, Stewart averaged 11.2 points per game to post the highest scoring average of the USA players. She was one of the five players named to the all tournament team; Ariel Massengale was the other USA player to earn all tournament honors.[91] 2011 Pan American Games[edit] She competed for the United States at the 2011 Pan American Games.[2] The USA Pan American team members were usually chosen from the college ranks, although many of the other countries use their national teams, which include professional players. Stewart was the only high school player chosen for the 2011 Pan American team, and only the second high school player in Pan American team history for the USA teams. The only other high school player on a Pan American team was Nancy Lieberman, who played on the 1975 team, almost 20 years before Stewart was born.[92] The 2011 team finished seventh, the first time in history they did not earn a medal, but Stewart, almost three years younger than the next youngest player, was still a major contributor, scoring 15.4 points per game to lead the team in scoring. She also led the team in blocks and rebounds.[citation needed] Stewart was named the 2011 USA Basketball Female Athlete of the Year. USA Basketball cited her performance on the U19 team and the Pan American team. She was the second youngest on the U19 team, yet led the team in points, rebounds and blocks, helping to lead her team to a gold medal at the international competition, and earning a position on the all-tournament team. She occupies several spots in the U19 record books. She was named to the Pan American team, only the second high school player from the US to receive such a bid. Despite playing with college age players, she earned a starting position for all games, and again led the team in points, rebounds and blocks. The previous year's winner of the award was Diana Taurasi.[25][93] U18[edit] Stewart was named to the USA Basketball U-18 team. She joined future UConn teammates Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck on the 12-player squad that competed in the 2012 FIBA Americas U-18 National Championship, held in August 2012, in Puerto Rico. Stewart was the youngest, and only high school player, on the 2011 USA Women's Pan American Games team, but was the player with the most international experience on the team.[94][95] The team started by winning their first four games with margins of victory of 40 points or more. This set up the championship game against Brazil. The team from Brazil started strong, and held a double-digit lead early in the game. After scoring only seven points in the first quarter, the team scored 21 or more in the next three quarters and reclaimed the lead. The USA won 71-47 to claim the gold medal.[96] Stewart was awarded the MVP trophy as the best player in the FIBA Americas U18 competition.[97] 2013 U19[edit] Stewart, along with teammates Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck, were three of the twelve players selected to be on the team representing the US at the U19 World Championship for Women held in Klaipėda and Panevėžys, Lithuania, in July 2013.[98] Stewart was named the USA Basketball Female Athlete of the Year for the second time. Only five other players have won this award more than once, Teresa Edwards, Lisa Leslie, Cheryl Miller, Dawn Staley and Diana Taurasi, and none have accomplished this at so young an age. Stewart helped the US to a 9-0 record in the 2013 FIBA U19 World Championship, leading to a gold medal for the team and MVP honors for Stewart.[99] Senior national team[edit] Stewart was one of 33 finalists for the U.S. Women's FIBA World Championship for Women Roster. She was the only collegiate player out of 32 WNBA women's basketball players to be selected by the USA Basketball Women's National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster to represent the US at the FIBA World Championship for Women in Turkey during September and October 2014. Stewart made the final roster of 12 players, announced on September 23, 2014. Stewart won the gold medal with the team in 2014.[100] Stewart was a member of the USA Women's Pan American Team which participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada July 10 to 26, 2015. The USA won games against Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, before losing the gold-medal game to the host team Canada.[101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108] Summer Olympics[edit] USA Basketball named Stewart to the squad that played at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. She won the gold medal with Team USA and joined Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, Ruth Riley, Tamika Catchings and fellow UConn alums Kara Wolters, Swin Cash, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, and Maya Moore, as female basketball players who have won NCAA titles, WNBA Championships, and Olympic gold medals.[109][110] She again won gold at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo where she averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds per game and was named the Olympic Tournament's Most Valuable Player and to the FIBA's All-Star Five team.[111][112] In June 2024, Stewart was named to her third US women's Olympic team to compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in France, alongside fellow Liberty teammate, Sabrina Ionescu.[113] Stewart and the United States defeated France 67-66 in the final, earning her third consecutive gold medal and the United States' eighth consecutive gold medal.[114] At the end of the Olympic tournament, she was again named to FIBA's All-Star Five team.[115] Off the court[edit] Personal life[edit] Stewart being interviewed at the New York Liberty championship parade in 2024 In 2018, Stewart posed nude for ESPN's The Body Issue magazine.[116] Stewart is married to former WNBA and EuroLeague Spanish professional basketball player Marta Xargay Casademont.[117][118] The couple started dating while teammates at Dynamo Kursk. Stewart proposed in May 2021, and they were married on July 6, 2021. In August 2021, about 48 hours after Stewart won an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo, their first child, Ruby Mae Stewart-Xargay, was born via surrogacy.[119] In May 2023, the couple announced via Instagram that Xargay Casademont was pregnant with their second child.[120] In October 2023, the couple's second child, Theo Josep Stewart Xargay, was born.[121] Business interests[edit] In 2016, Stewart signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike.[122] In 2021, she signed a multi-year sponsorship with Puma.

Talbot was a member of the Australian Women's basketball team (Opals) at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Opals were eliminated after losing to the USA in the quarterfinals.[1] Career[edit] WNBL[edit] Talbot began her career at just the age of 17, playing with the Adelaide Lightning for the 2011-12 WNBL season. In just her second season, Talbot was recognised as one of the brightest prospects in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), winning the 2013 Betty Watson Rookie of the Year award.[2] In accepting her award, Talbot was asked what she had learned from playing with Olympians Suzy Batkovic, Laura Hodges and Jennifer Screen, and she replied ""Shitloads"".[3] In 2018, Talbot returned to the league after signing with the Melbourne Boomers.[4] This was her first season back after spending two seasons overseas in Europe. In 2019, it was announced Talbot would re-join the Adelaide Lightning, returning to both her home state and her first WNBL team.[5] In 2020, Talbot re-signed with the Adelaide Lightning for her second consecutive season.[6] In June 2023, Talbot re-signed with the Lightning for four more seasons.[7] WNBA[edit] In 2014, Talbot nominated for the WNBA draft, where she was selected in the third round (33rd overall) by the Phoenix Mercury.[8] Talbot opted to play for the Canberra Capitals for the WNBL 2014-15 season.[9] In 2017, the Phoenix Mercury re-acquired Talbot.[10] In 2019, Talbot was traded to the Minnesota Lynx after two seasons with the Mercury.[11] In the off-season, she was traded to the New York Liberty for draft pick Erica Ogwumike.[12] After electing to sit-out the 2020 season, Talbot's rights remained with the Liberty. In February 2021, the Liberty traded their negotiating rights to the Seattle Storm.[13] Talbot would subsequently sign a training camp contract with the Storm.[14] She played for the Storm for two seasons. On 1 February 2023, Talbot signed a two-year contract with the Los Angeles Sparks.[15] She missed the 2023 WNBA season due to an ACL injury sustained while playing in Australia.[16] On 22 August 2024, Talbot signed a one-year contract extension with the Sparks.[17] On 6 December 2024, Talbot was selected as the Golden State Valkyries' pick from the Sparks' 2024 roster in the WNBA expansion draft.[18] On 13 July 2025, Talbot was waived by the Valkyries.[19] On 21 July 2025, Talbot signed with the Liberty.[20] National team[edit] Youth Level[edit] Talbot made her international debut for the Sapphires at the 2009 FIBA Under-16 Oceania Championship in Brisbane. Later in 2013, Talbot was a member of the bronze medal winning team at the World Championship held in Lithuania.[21] At that tournament, Talbot was named to the World Championship All-Star Five. Senior Level[edit] Talbot is a current member of the Australian Women's basketball training squad. At official senior FIBA tournaments, Talbot has played for the Opals at the 2015 Oceania Women's Championship, 2016 Olympic Games and 2018 World Cup.[22] Talbot, like all the other members of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Opals women's basketball team, had a difficult tournament. The Opals lost their first two group stage matches. They looked flat against Belgium and then lost to China in heartbreaking circumstances. In their last group match the Opals needed to beat Puerto Rico by 25 or more in their final match to progress. This they did by 27 in a very exciting match. However, they lost to the United States in their quarterfinal 79 to 55.[23] Career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game TO Turnovers per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage Bold Career best degrees League leader WNBA[edit] Regular season[edit] Stats current as of game on July 7, 2025 WNBA regular season statistics[24] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2014 Did not appear in WNBA 2015 2016 Did not appear in WNBA (Olympics) 2017 Phoenix 34 24 17.9 .415 .381 .652 2.7 1.6 0.7 0.3 0.9 4.4 2018 Phoenix 31 8 14.6 .464 .386 .905 1.9 1.3 0.4 0.3 0.9 3.7 2019 Minnesota 33 10 17.0 .370 .326 .871 2.4 1.2 0.9 0.3 1.3 5.2 2020 Did not play (opted out) 2021 Seattle 30 9 17.9 .483 .415 .750 2.9 1.6 0.5 0.4 1.6 5.7 2022 Seattle 34 1 16.1 .464 .397 .583 3.1 1.3 0.7 0.3 1.1 5.0 2023 Did not play (injury) 2024 Los Angeles 37 10 16.2 .395 .260 .690 2.7 2.1 0.5 0.5 1.0 3.5 2025 Golden State 16 10 16.8 .339 .250 .643 3.3 2.0 0.6 0.1 1.2 3.6 Career 7 years, 5 teams 215 72 16.6 .423 .352 .723 2.7 1.6 0.6 0.3 1.1 4.5 Playoffs[edit] WNBA playoff statistics Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TO PPG 2017 Phoenix 4 0 5.7 .750 .500 1.000 0.5 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.5 2.0 2018 Phoenix 4 4 27.1 .474 .333 .600 5.3 2.8 1.0 0.0 2.2 6.3 2019 Minnesota 1 0 14.9 .500 .500 - 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 2021 Seattle 1 0 17.0 .500 .000 .000 4.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 6.0 2022 Seattle 6 2 21.3 .448 .500 .600 4.3 1.7 0.5 0.5 1.0 6.2 Career 5 years, 3 teams 16 6 18.2 .484 .412 .583 3.4 1.4 0.5 0.3 1.1 5.1 See also[edit] List of Australian WNBA players WNBL Rookie of the Year Award References[edit] External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Stephanie Talbot.
