[ 53 ] She thus became the third WNBA player to dunk and first to do so twice in one game. [ 54 ] She was a dominant defensive force in the league over the season, averaging 3.0 blocks per game. Griner was named a WNBA All-Star, but missed the 2013 WNBA All-Star Game with a right knee injury, and was replaced by Tina Thompson . [ 55 ] In April 2013, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he would consider drafting Griner to the NBA , and Griner expressed interest in the opportunity, but no offer to try out was extended by the team. [ 56 ] 2014 In the 2014 season, Griner's stats would improve, as she averaged 15.6 points per game, 8.0 rebounds per game and 3.7 blocks per game.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] 2023 Griner missed the entire 2022 season because she was incarcerated on drug charges in Russia. She was released in December as part of a prisoner swap between the United States and Russia . In 2023 Griner performed well, and was named a starter in the 2023 WNBA All-Star Game .

[ 92 ] During the medal ceremony when the U.S. national anthem was played, Griner would get emotional at the event, thinking she wouldn't even be here again following her previous arrest in Russia back in 2022. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Honors Along with being selected as the number-one high school player in the country by Rivals.com , Griner was featured on the cover of ESPN 's Rise magazine, [ 96 ] and was selected by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association as the 2009 State Farm / WBCA High School Player of the Year.

[ 109 ] The WNBA included Griner in The W25 , a list of the best players of the league's first 25 years. [ 110 ] She was also named one of ESPNW's Impact 25 in 2014. [ 111 ] In February 2024, Baylor University retired Griner's No. 42 jersey in a ceremony preceding a game versus Texas Tech. [ 112 ] Personal life and activism In an interview with SI.com on February 11, 2013, Griner publicly came out as a lesbian. [ 113 ] She also revealed in the interview that she was bullied as a child, explaining, ""It's hard. Just being picked on for being different. Just being bigger, my sexuality, everything."" She said she is very passionate about working with children in order to bring attention to the issue of bullying, particularly against LGBT people. [ 113 ] Griner had previously come out to her parents in high school, which her father did not accept gracefully, forcing her to live with an assistant coach for six weeks during her senior year. [ 114 ] She later wrote a memoir with Sue Hovey addressing bullying and self-acceptance, In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court , published in 2014. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] In a 2019 interview with People , Griner stated, ""People tell me I'm going to break the barrier and trailblaze. I just kind of look at it like, I'm just trying to help out, I'm just trying to make it not as tough for the next generation."" [ 116 ] In 2013, Griner was featured on the cover of ESPN Magazine . She appeared in ""The Taboo Issue"" . [ 117 ] She is pictured holding a snake, which is her favorite animal because they are ""misunderstood"". [ 118 ] She says, ""You just have to look at it in a different way."" [ 118 ] Her endorsement deal with Nike was the first time the company had signed such a deal with an openly gay athlete . [ 119 ] Griner continues to push back on traditional gender roles as she regularly models clothes branded as ""menswear"" for Nike. [ 118 ] Nike spokesman Brian Strong said of signing Griner, ""We can't get into specifics, but it's safe to say we jumped at the opportunity to work with her because she breaks the mold."" [ 118 ] In 2020, Griner, along with teammate Brianna Turner , called for the WNBA to stop playing the United States national anthem before the games. She made her remarks after Mercury players refused to take the floor during a pre-season game in Bradenton, Florida . Griner said she was protesting the killing of Breonna Taylor as part of the wider George Floyd protests . [ 120 ] She said later during a media teleconference, ""I honestly feel we should not play the national anthem during our season. I think we should take that much of a stand."" [ 121 ] She said she does not believe that the national anthem should be played at sporting events. [ 122 ] Since her release from detention in Russia in December 2022, Griner has championed the return of others detained in foreign countries; [ 123 ] she has also stated her experiences of being detained in a Russian jail have led her to appreciate the ""uniquely American freedoms"" citizens of her country take for granted or overlook. As such, she resumed standing for the national anthem beginning with the 2023 season. [ 124 ] On February 17, 2025, Griner cancelled a speaking engagement for a cannabis leadership summit at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland , after a piece of duct tape with the words ""Gay Baby Jail"" written on it was found near her hotel room, which she perceived to be a threat. According to detectives at the Prince George's County Police Department , the words ""Gay Baby Jail"" was an apparent video game reference, and may have been connected to a large anime and video game convention that had recently taken place at the event center. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Previous marriage and disorderly conduct case On August 14, 2014, Griner got engaged to fellow WNBA player Glory Johnson . [ 127 ] [ 128 ] On April 22, 2015, they were both arrested on charges of assault and disorderly conduct after police responded to a fight between the two in their suburban home in Phoenix, Arizona . Both had sustained minor injuries. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Despite this incident, they married the following month on May 8, 2015, in Phoenix. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] On May 15, 2015, the WNBA suspended Griner and Johnson for seven games each after Griner pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges. Griner was also required to complete 26 weeks of domestic violence counseling. [ 133 ] On June 4, 2015, Griner and Johnson revealed that Johnson was pregnant with twins, [ 134 ] conceived with Johnson's eggs through in vitro fertilization . [ 135 ] The following day, and after less than a month of marriage, Griner filed for an annulment of the marriage citing fraud and duress; [ 136 ] the annulment was denied. [ 137 ] Johnson gave birth to twin girls on October 12, 2015, 16 weeks premature. [ 138 ] Griner was ordered to pay child support to Johnson. [ 138 ] The couple's divorce was finalized in June 2016. [ 139 ] Marriage Griner became engaged to Cherelle Watson in August 2018, [ 140 ] and they married in June 2019. [ 139 ] In 2024, Griner and her wife Cherelle announced a pregnancy. [ 141 ] In July 2024, Cherelle gave birth to a boy, whom they named Bash. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] 2022 arrest and imprisonment in Russia Main article: Viktor Bout-Brittney Griner prisoner exchange On February 17, 2022, Griner was arrested on drug smuggling charges in Russia. She was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport after the Federal Customs Service found she was carrying vaporizer cartridges containing less than a gram of hash oil. In Arizona, she had been prescribed medicinal cannabis , which is illegal in Russia. [ 144 ] [ 18 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Some U.S. officials expressed concern that Russia may have been using Griner as leverage in response to the international sanctions imposed against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine . The former Pentagon official Evelyn Farkas expressed concern that Griner could be used as a ""high-profile hostage"" by Russia. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] In May 2022, the U.S. State Department stated that they had determined Griner was being ""wrongfully detained"". [ 149 ] On May 15, 2022, it was reported that the United States and Russia would consider a prisoner swap, with Russia exchanging Griner for arms dealer Viktor Bout , who had served 10 years of a 25-year federal prison sentence in the United States, on charges of conspiracy to kill American citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles , and providing aid to a terrorist organization. [ 150 ] Trial, sentencing, imprisonment, and release Fans at the 2022 NWSL Championship were invited to write letters to Griner. On the second day of her trial, July 7, 2022, Griner pleaded guilty [ a ] but said she had no intent to break the law. Griner requested that she be allowed to give testimony to the court. [ 152 ] [ 151 ] On August 4, 2022, the court found Griner guilty and sentenced her to nine years in prison and fined her 1 million rubles (US$16,301), even though the standard sentence for possession of no more than 2 grams of hash oil is 15 days. [ 19 ] [ 153 ] On November 17, Griner's lawyers said that she was transferred to IK-2 , a female penal colony in the town of Yavas in the region of Mordovia [ 20 ] (previously, she had been held at an undisclosed location). [ 154 ] Griner's family enlisted the help of Bring Our Families Home to appeal for her release. [ 21 ] On December 8, 2022, she was released by Russia in a 1-for-1 prisoner swap for Viktor Bout . [ 22 ] At the same time as the exchange, Russia deported another American, Sarah Krivanek, detained for a domestic violence dispute.

She played college basketball at South Carolina and Oregon . High school career [ edit ] Paopao played basketball for La Jolla Country Day School in La Jolla , San Diego , California. As a 10 year old, Paopao was the starting point guard for a U16 team. When she was 14 years old, Kelsey Plum said of Paopao, ""She's just never scared. It's like a fearlessness but a confidence that she has... I think she could start in the Pac-12 right now... Honestly, I think she could be the best to come out of San Diego."" Plum would often invite Paopao to train with her, stating ""Even to this day, when I go back, that's the only kid I would let work out with me, because she can hang with the intensity... She pushes me because I'm like, 'I can't let a 12-year-old beat me in this shooting drill."" [ 1 ] However, she suffered a torn ACL in each of her first two high school seasons. [ 2 ] As a senior, Paopao averaged 22.7 points, 8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 3.3 steals per game. She led her team to a 32-1 record and the Southern California Open Division regional title, but the state championship game was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Paopao received McDonald's All-American honors and was named California Gatorade Player of the Year and California Ms. Basketball. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Rated a five-star recruit by ESPN , she committed to playing college basketball for Oregon over offers from California, Oregon State and UCLA, among other programs. [ 5 ] College career [ edit ] Paopao entered her freshman season as Oregon's starting point guard , replacing Sabrina Ionescu . Kelly Graves , head coach of Oregon, had high praise for her: ""I think Te-Hina is next in the line of those guards that we've had that can just fill up the stat sheet. She's a good rebounder, an excellent passer, an elite-level shooter,"" Graves said. ""I'm not saying she's another Sabrina, but she's got the ability to impact the game in multiple ways like Sabrina did."" She had chosen Oregon over other programs because Oregon had not stopped recruiting her amidst the injuries she faced through high school. [ 6 ] She was part of the top-recruiting class, being one of the five five-start recruits, dubbed the ""Fab Five"". As a freshman, she started all games played and averaged 10.2 points, 4.4 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game, missing her last five games with a foot injury. [ 7 ] Paopao earned All- Pac-12 honors and All-Freshmen selection - being one of only two players in the league to earn both honors. She also led all NCAA freshmen with a 2.40 assist-to-turnover ratio while ranking fourth in the Pac-12 in assists per game. Paopao with South Carolina in 2024 As a sophomore, Paopao was sidelined early in the season due to injury. She averaged 13.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, repeating as an All-Pac-12 selection. [ 4 ] She repeated with All- Pac-12 honors in her sophomore year. [ 8 ] By sophomore year, all the other four five-star recruits from Paopao's recruiting class had transferred out of Oregon. However, Paopao confirmed her stance to stay with the Oregon program. [ 9 ] Two years later in a podcast, she revealed that while her family had encouraged her to transfer as well, she chose to stay to be 'loyal' to the program who had stuck with her through her high school injuries. [ 10 ] In her junior season, Paopao averaged 13.1 points, 4.2 rebounds 3.3 assists per game, earning All- Pac-12 honorable mention. [ 11 ] Te-hina had faced a 6 game shooting slump this season, [ 12 ] she later talks about how it had affected her mental health. [ 10 ] Despite the slump, her 3PT% stats still concluded at 44%. [ 13 ] Paopao with South Carolina before the 2024 NCAA championship game For her senior season, she transferred out of Oregon and was recruited by Dawn Staley to South Carolina for her 3-point shooting skills, leadership and experience. [ 14 ] Staley has commented on the impact of Paopao on their team, ""It makes a big difference for someone like Pao, who is always calm, cool, collected. You know what her capabilities are. You know that you've got to guard her. She doesn't take bad shots, so it's great to have that on the floor and great to get our starting five back together just playing as a cohesive unit."" [ 15 ] At the end of the regular season, Paopao was the nation's top percentage 3-point shooter, hitting a career-high 48.6 percent from beyond the arc, and is among the SEC's top 10 with 3.8 assists per game. She leads the SEC and is 19th in the nation in player offensive rating (Her Hoop Stats). Her 11.5 points per game include 15 games shooting at least 50.0 percent from the field and 11 games of at least three 3-pointers. In six games against ranked opponents, she is the Gamecocks' top scorer at 15.0 points per game on 48.7 percent 3-point shooting. On the season, her 11.5 points per game and the 8.8 points per game teammates score on her assists, means Paopao has had her hand on 23.2 percent of the Gamecocks' total offense. Against ranked opponents, that number rises to 29.8 percent. Paopao was named as ""Finalist"" for the Nancy Lieberman Award , alongside Georgia Amoore , Caitlin Clark , Hannah Hidalgo , and Jacy Sheldon . [ 16 ] After Senior Day, Te-Hina declared that she will be returning for her fifth year of eligibility. [ 17 ] Professional career [ edit ] On April 14, 2025, Paopao was drafted by the Atlanta Dream with the eighteenth pick in the second round.

She played college basketball with the UCLA Bruins of the Pac-12 Conference . Early life and college [ edit ] In high school, Onyenwere was named a McDonald's All-American in 2017. [ 1 ] Following the 2017-18 season , Onyenwere was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team.

[ 4 ] Onyenwere was the leading candidate for most of the season, winning every Rookie of the Month award to become just the fifth player in WNBA history to sweep that honor during a season, and fell just two votes shy of winning unanimously. Onyenwere started in 29 of 32 games and was the most productive player in the class by some margin. She averaged 8.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game, leading all rookies in scoring and 3-pointers made (37). [ 5 ] Onyenwere's role diminished in her second season with the Liberty under new head coach Sandy Brondello . Onyenwere was moved to the bench and started only one game all season. She also struggled with nagging injuries since the start of the training camp, which contributed to her minutes decreasing from an average of 22.2 minutes in 2021 to 13.7 minutes in 2022. With the Liberty acquiring star frontcourt players such as Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones before the 2023 season , Onyenwere's roster spot was in question and she was consequently traded.

[ 60 ] She later explained that she wanted a fresh start and a coach who would develop her into a stretch four to prepare her for the WNBA. [ 36 ] She was the most heralded transfer in the nation and took visits to Louisiana State University (LSU), South Carolina and Tennessee . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] She took interest in LSU after Ohio State transfer Kateri Poole, whom she had known since high school, suggested that they visit the school together. [ 36 ] Junior season On May 6, 2022, LSU announced that Reese would transfer to their program. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] She made the decision due to her trust in head coach Kim Mulkey and a desire to join a ""winning culture"". [ 63 ] Reese was also impressed by the school's interest in the women's team.

Her actions came under scrutiny, with some journalists and analysts criticizing her for poor sportsmanship and others, including Reese herself, pointing to a double standard , because Clark had not received similar backlash for making the ""you can't see me"" gesture two games earlier. [ 77 ] Clark later defended Reese from criticism over the gesture. [ 78 ] The incident drew attention to the roles of race and gender in the perception of trash talk in sports since Reese is Black and Clark is white. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] It has also been described as the origin of a rivalry between Reese and Clark. [ 82 ] Following the game, First Lady Jill Biden remarked that she wanted Iowa to be invited to the White House along with LSU, as an addition to the custom of the president and first lady hosting the national champions. Despite Biden's press secretary clarifying that only LSU would be invited, Reese initially rejected the invitation and said she would prefer to celebrate with the Obamas , before accepting it with her team later that week. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] President Joe Biden called Reese individually to congratulate her on LSU's victory.

Her father built a sports court with a basketball goal behind the family house, but she almost never played there, choosing instead to play at a hoop in front of a neighbor's house where she could easily be seen by other children in the neighborhood. She regularly played against boys. [ 1 ] During the third grade, she wrote a school paper about her dreams of one day playing in the WNBA . [ 9 ] While Vandersloot regularly played basketball and many other sports as a child--she was also on a fast-pitch softball team that was runner-up in a Washington state tournament at age 11-- her favorite sport was soccer; she had a poster of Mia Hamm on her bedroom wall. [ 9 ] She did not concentrate on basketball until high school: I grew up wanting to go to North Carolina because of Mia Hamm. Once I got into high school and basketball started interfering with club soccer I found I dreaded going to soccer practice. I was having so much fun developing my game. I just fell in love with it. [ 1 ] High school [ edit ] Vandersloot became a basketball star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6 inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either before or after the team's practice. He would later say, ""I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' "" She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble. [ 9 ] A pivotal moment in her life came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the Gonzaga University girls' basketball camp. She would say about the trip in 2011, ""I just fell in love with this place. I felt so comfortable here."" The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves , who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament. [ 1 ] That season, she had averaged more than 18 points and 7 assists as she led Kentwood to its first state tournament appearance; they would lose in the second round of the tournament to Spokane's University High , led by future Tennessee star Angie Bjorklund . After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider Washington or another Pac-10 school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small. [ 1 ] She would eventually sign with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, ""I wasn't really being highly recruited and I just didn't want to go through the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga."" [ 9 ] Vandersloot took her game to another level as a senior, averaging 26 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals while leading Kentwood to a third-place finish in the state tournament; their only loss was in the state semifinals. She scored 113 points in the tournament, one shy of the state record for a girls' tournament, and was named MVP. Vandersloot was also consensus first-team all-state, and was named the state's player of the year by the Seattle Times . [ 10 ] Vandersloot was rated as the No. 64 national prospect, [ 11 ] and No. 35 among guards, [ 12 ] by Scout.com . College career [ edit ] By her own admission, Vandersloot came to Gonzaga as a shy freshman. During that first season, Graves suggested that she call the school's greatest point guard in history for advice-- Hall of Famer John Stockton . Vandersloot would recall that it ""took me a couple of weeks to build up,"" [ 1 ] and when she finally called Stockton for the first time, she hoped that she would reach his voice mail so she wouldn't have to talk. [ 13 ] Vandersloot eventually worked with Stockton throughout her Gonzaga career. [ 1 ] As a freshman in 2007-08, she was the West Coast Conference newcomer of the year and named to the 10-member All-WCC first team after averaging 10.3 points, 5.7 assists, and 1.9 steals per game entering the WCC tournament , finishing in the top five in the WCC in the latter two categories while the Zags went 13-1 in conference play and earned the tournament's top seed. [ 14 ] However, the Bulldogs lost in the WCC final to San Diego [ 15 ] and ultimately missed out on the NCAA Tournament, playing instead in the WNIT . They defeated UC Davis in the first round [ 16 ] before falling to Colorado in the second round. [ 17 ] In her 2008-09 sophomore season, she set a school record in assists with 239; [ 1 ] at the end of the regular season, her average of 7.3 per game led the conference, and she was also third in the conference in scoring at 16.4 per game. [ 18 ] Vandersloot won the first of what would be three WCC Player of the Year awards. [ 18 ] The Bulldogs went on to win the WCC tournament , with Vandersloot named tournament MVP. [ 19 ] In the NCAA tournament , the Zags defeated Xavier for the program's first NCAA Tournament win [ 20 ] before narrowly losing in the second round to Pitt . [ 21 ] As a junior in 2009-10, Vandersloot led Division I in assists, averaging 9.4 per game, [ 22 ] while leading the Zags to an unbeaten record in conference play. [ 23 ] During that season, she broke her own school record for assists in a season with 321, [ 22 ] and also broke the Gonzaga and WCC records for career assists. [ 1 ] Vandersloot was again named both WCC Player of the Year [ 23 ] and WCC Tournament MVP [ 24 ] while leading the Bulldogs to a second consecutive WCC Tournament title. In the NCAA tournament , Vandersloot led the Zags one round farther than in 2009, upsetting No. 2 seed (and 2011 champion ) Texas A&M before losing in the Sweet Sixteen to the Xavier team they had knocked out the year before. [ 20 ] Her senior year at Gonzaga, 2010-11, can be summed up as a season of milestones. She led the WCC in both scoring and assists on the way to a second straight unbeaten season in conference play. [ 25 ] Vandersloot was named WCC Player of the Year for an unprecedented [ 1 ] third time. [ 25 ] The Zags again won the WCC Tournament, and Vandersloot was named tournament MVP for the third straight time, [ 26 ] also becoming the first women's player in WCC history to win that honor three times. [ 1 ] In the NCAA tournament , the Bulldogs were a No. 11 seed, but had the advantage of playing their first-round and potential second-round games at their home court of McCarthey Athletic Center . They would take full advantage of their home court in the first two rounds. The Zags, seeded No. 11 in their region, opened the tournament with a 92-86 upset of Iowa , with Vandersloot scoring a career-high 34 points. [ 27 ] In their second-round game against No. 3 seed UCLA , Vandersloot finished with 29 points and 17 assists, one assist shy of the record for a Division I tournament game, as the Zags took down the Bruins 89-75. During that game, she became the first player in Division I history to amass 2,000 career points and 1,000 career assists. [ 2 ] The win advanced them to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight year, and to a regional tournament that would be held less than two miles (3.2 km) from the Gonzaga campus at Spokane Arena . During the Bulldogs' next game, a 76-69 win over Louisville , Vandersloot broke the Division I women's record for assists in a season previously held by Suzie McConnell . She finished with 29 points, 7 assists, and 7 steals as the Zags became the lowest-seeded team ever to reach a regional final in the women's tournament. [ 28 ] Their tournament run, and Vandersloot's college career, would end one game later as Stanford would defeat the Zags 83-60. While she finished with 25 points, only four came in the second half. [ 29 ] In addition to her other milestones during the season, she also broke the Gonzaga single-season scoring record. [ 30 ] Vandersloot became one of the most decorated players of the 2010-11 season. She won the women's Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the top Division I player no taller than 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m), [ 31 ] and the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top point guard in Division I women's basketball. [ 30 ] She was also named to multiple All-America teams. The AP named her a second-team All-America; she became the first women's player in WCC history to be named to that specific team. [ 32 ] She also was named to the five-woman Wooden All-America Team, another honor never before achieved by a WCC player. [ 33 ] Finally, she was named to the 10-player USBWA All-America team, becoming the first Gonzaga player so honored, [ 34 ] and the 10-member State Farm Coaches All-America team, another first for a WCC player. [ 35 ] Her impact on the Gonzaga program can be measured by another statistic--home attendance. The year before she arrived in Spokane , the Bulldogs averaged 1,492 with a team that would make its first NCAA tournament appearance. By her junior year, attendance had risen to 2,935, and rose again to 3,824 in her senior season, with the Zags selling out the McCarthey Athletic Center twice before the NCAA tournament. [ 1 ] On February 11, 2023, Vandersloot had her number retired, becoming the first Gonzaga women's basketball player to receive the honor.

Her relatively small size had been a subject of concern, as was her defense--despite averaging 4.5 steals per game in the 2011 NCAA tournament and ending her Gonzaga career with 366. [ 37 ] However, she was seen as likely to be one of the top seven picks, [ 38 ] and was ultimately picked third overall by the Chicago Sky. [ 3 ] One indicator of her likely draft position was that Indiana Fever coach Lin Dunn , whose team needed depth at point guard going into the 2011 season , signed Shannon Bobbitt in February, convinced that Vandersloot would be picked before the Fever's turn at #9. [ 37 ] John Stockton gave Vandersloot high praise, stating, ""I don't want to dramatize it too much but she's like Gretzky in hockey. There is something that separates Courtney from others."" [ 1 ] In her rookie season , she became the Sky's regular starter at the point, ultimately starting 26 of the team's 34 games. [ 39 ] Her average of 3.7 assists per game (apg) was 11th in the league [ 39 ] and second among rookies. [ 40 ] She was also named as an Eastern Conference reserve for the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game , [ 4 ] and was one of the five members of the 2011 All-Rookie Team , gaining 10 of a possible 11 votes from the league's head coaches. [ 5 ] She became a regular starter for the Sky in subsequent seasons, and helped lead the team to the 2014 WNBA Finals against the Phoenix Mercury in her fourth season, but the Sky were swept 3-0. The 2014 season also marked the first time Vandersloot led the league in assists per game (5.7). In the 2015 season , Vandersloot led the league in total assists (but came in second in assists-per-game to Candace Parker ). In the 2017 season , she led the league in assists for the second time in her career, setting the single-season league record for assists per game at 8.1 apg and the record for most assists over a 15-game stretch with 149. [ 41 ] However, despite these efforts, the Sky finished 12-22, missing out on the playoffs for the first time in four years. In the 2018 season , Vandersloot broke the single-season record for assists and finished off the season with 258 assists and her own assists per game record with 8.6 apg. [ 42 ] On July 20, 2018, Vandersloot became the seventh player in league history to post a triple-double, she scored 13 points along with 10 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists in a 114-99 victory over the Dallas Wings . [ 43 ] She also averaged a career-high in scoring. Despite these performances, the Sky missed out on the playoffs yet again, they finished 13-21. Courtney Vandersloot on the Jumbotron at Barclays center during the 2024 WNBA Playoffs In the 2019 season , Vandersloot continued to exceed assists records. She broke her own league record with 9.1 assists per game. She was selected to the 2019 WNBA All-Star Game , making it her second All-Star appearance. Her season performance would help the Sky return to the playoffs with a 20-14 record, earning the number 5 seed. In the first-round elimination game, the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury 105-76 to advance. In the second-round elimination game, the Sky were defeated by the Las Vegas Aces 93-92 after a late game desperation half-court shot by Dearica Hamby . In the 2020 season , the season was shortened to 22 games in a bubble at IMG Academy due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Vandersloot would average a career-high in scoring and once again set a new record for assists per game with 10, while playing and starting all 22 games. The Sky finished as the number 6 seed with a 12-10 record, but were eliminated by the Connecticut Sun in the first round elimination game. Courtney Vandersloot holds the New York Liberty's 2024 WNBA Championship Trophy during a at a post-win celebration at the Barclay's Center. In the 2021 season , Vandersloot started all 32 games for the Sky and once again led the league with 8.6 assists per game. The Sky finished the season as the sixth seed with a 16-16 record, but went on to a successful run in the playoffs, winning two single-elimination games and a semifinals series against the first-seeded Connecticut Sun to reach the Finals for the first time since 2014. In the 2021 WNBA Finals , Vandersloot recorded 12.5 assists and 11.5 points per game, as the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury in four games to win their first championship. Across the 10 games in the 2021 postseason, she recorded 10.2 assists and 13 points per game. After the 2022 season, Vandersloot became a free agent and signed with the New York Liberty in February 2023. [ 44 ] The New York Liberty placed second in the WNBA to the Las Vegas Aces in 2023. In 2024, the Liberty won the WNBA Championship over the Minnesota Lynx. Courtney dedicated the season to her mother, Jan Vandersloot, who died in mid-summer 2024. [ 45 ] In 2025, Vandersloot returned to the Sky. [ 8 ] On June 8, 2025, it was announced that Vandersloot had sustained a right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear during the June 7 game against the Indiana Fever, would undergo surgery, and would miss the rest of the 2025 season. [ 46 ] European leagues [ edit ] In 2011, she signed with the Turkish club Beşiktaş . [ 47 ] Because the WNBA season is held in the northern hemisphere summer, the traditional offseason for basketball throughout the world, many of the league's players participate in overseas leagues during the traditional season and return to their WNBA teams in the summer. In February 2022, after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , she left UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian Women's Basketball Premier League . [ 48 ] In April 2022, she joined Hungarian club Sopron Basket for the 2022-23 European season. [ 49 ] In January 2023, she signed with Fenerbahçe and left at end of the season. Unrivaled [ edit ] On September 16, 2024, it was announced that Vandersloot would appear and play in the inaugural season of Unrivaled , a new women's 3-on-3 basketball league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart . [ 50 ] Personal life [ edit ] On December 27, 2018, Vandersloot married Chicago Sky teammate, Allie Quigley , in Seattle, near Vandersloot's hometown of Kent, Washington . [ 51 ] In May 2025, the couple announced the birth of their first child.

[ 12 ] Charles was named the 2010 WNBA Rookie of the Year. In her first season, she set all-time league records for rebounds, with 398 (a record that has since been broken by Jonquel Jones in 2017), and double-doubles with 22. (both scoring and rebounds in double digits). [ 13 ] On September 2, 2011, Tina Charles had 10 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds for the first triple-double in Connecticut Sun history, and only the fifth such accomplishment in WNBA history. Charles had eight assists at halftime, and was taken out of the game with nine, because the lead over the opponent was so large. The coach did put her back in the game in the fourth quarter, and she earned an assist on a pass to Jessica Moore, leading to the triple double. [ 14 ] However, subsequent review by the league resulted in a change, as three of the assists should not have been credited to Charles, so she ended the game with seven assists, not ten. [ 15 ] On August 18, 2012, Charles recorded nine rebounds in an 85-74 win over the Liberty. One of the rebounds in the second quarter pushed her career total to 1,000. She accomplished this milestone faster than any other WNBA player in history. She reached 1,000 rebounds in her 89th game, surpassing the record formerly held by Yolanda Griffith , who reached 1,000 rebounds in her 92nd game. [ 16 ] Charles was named the 2012 MVP of the WNBA, winning 25 of 41 first place votes. She led the league in the number of double-doubles recorded, and set the mark for the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 900, 1,000 and 1,100 rebounds. [ 17 ] New York Liberty (2014-2019) [ edit ] In the weeks leading up to the 2014 WNBA draft , rumors had circulated that Charles could be traded before the draft, so the Sun could obtain more draft picks. Just before the Draft, Charles was traded to her native team the New York Liberty in exchange for Kelsey Bone , the fourth overall pick in the 2014 WNBA draft ( Alyssa Thomas ) and the fourth overall pick in the 2015 WNBA draft ( Elizabeth Williams ). Charles with the New York Liberty in 2015 In 2016, Charles had the best season of her career, averaging a career-high 21.5 points per game while shooting 43.9% from the field and 81.2% from the free-throw line. [ 18 ] Charles had also led the league in rebounds with 9.9 rebounds per game, winning her fourth rebounding title. Her scoring average was tied with Elena Delle Donne but led the league in total points scored which allowed her to claim the scoring title. [ 19 ] The Liberty finished with a 21-13 record.

On June 4, 2019, Charles became the Liberty's all-time scoring leader after a late-fourth quarter layup in a 78-73 loss to the Los Angeles Sparks . She finished the game with 21 points and 14 rebounds. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Washington Mystics (2021) [ edit ] On April 15, 2020, Charles was traded to the Washington Mystics . [ 24 ] Charles was medically excused for the shortened 2020 season on July 17, 2020, due to her condition with extrinsic asthma, which impacts her immune system and put her at risk in the coronavirus pandemic. [ 25 ] Since 2013, Charles has donated her full WNBA salary to the charity she started, Hopey's Heart Foundation. In 2020, Charles announced she would direct that year's salary to support the Black Lives Matter movement.

[ 44 ] Charles was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma .

Mabrey was drafted in the second round (19th pick overall) by the Los Angeles Sparks in the 2019 WNBA draft . She previously played with the United States women's national under-19 basketball team and the University of Notre Dame . Mabrey was traded to the Dallas Wings in 2020. [ 3 ] She has played internationally in Latvia ( TTT Riga ), [ 4 ] Israel (Bnot Hertzeliya), [ 5 ] Australia ( Perth Lynx ), [ 6 ] Italy ( PF Schio ), [ 7 ] and Turkey ( Çukurova Basketbol ). She also played in the inaugural season of Unrivaled , [ 8 ] the 3-on-3 league developed by WNBA players Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier ; however, Mabrey was sidelined for all but 3 games of the Unrivaled season due to a calf injury. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Early life [ edit ] Mabrey was raised in Belmar, New Jersey to Patti and Roy Mabrey. [ 10 ] She has two brothers, Ryan and Roy, and two sisters Michaela and Dara. It was Roy's and Michaela's love of basketball that first involved Marina in the game. Her mother coached basketball in their area and Marina, Roy and Michaela would go along with their mother and join in the practices. Fierce basketball competition became a part of family life in the Mabrey household with Marina frequently competing with her older brother and sister in their driveway and local park. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Mabrey attended Manasquan High School in Manasquan, New Jersey , where she was part of two teams that won the state Tournament of Champions [ 14 ] and shared most valuable player honors in the McDonald's All-American Game in 2015. [ 13 ] Despite her sister Michaela's success as part of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team, [ 12 ] Marina doubted whether or not to choose that college when she was considering many offers for a basketball scholarship after high school. She chose to join up with coach Muffet McGraw 's squad at Notre Dame in 2015. [ 13 ] College career [ edit ] Mabrey joined sister Michaela in the 2015-16 Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team , following a season in which the team were runners-up in the national championship but required some rebuilding.

[ 15 ] The Notre Dame team for the following two years saw records fall, two national championship games and one championship victory. Mabrey was a key component of a team that survived a rash of injuries that won the 2018 national championship and commented later that the injuries had given the now smaller team an added mental toughness that ""there is no-one else to sub in"" and that they had to battle through. [ 16 ] The fighting mentality led to comebacks throughout the season with Mabrey moving to a more direct point guard role and taking more leadership with the largest fightback in Notre Dame history coming back against Tennessee from 23 points behind. The team executed the largest comeback in a championship game in NCAA women's basketball history, overcoming a 15-point deficit to achieve a 61-58 victory over fellow No. 1 seed Mississippi State.

Anne's father was the football coach and a school administrator at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines . Caitlin grew up in the city. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] She began playing basketball at age five and competed in boys' recreational leagues , because her father could not find a girls' league for her age group.

[ 268 ] Her impact on the women's game is likened to that of Stephen Curry on the men's game. [ 269 ] USA Today stated that she, like Curry, has ""redefined what a good shot is in basketball."" [ 270 ] The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Gay wrote in 2024: ""Clark is far from the first great shooter in women's basketball, but she's the one who is changing the dimensionality of the game, because of the distance she can shoot from and how well she can pass.""

[ 133 ] The Iowa women's basketball program sold out its 2023-24 ticket slate and generated $3.26 million in ticket sale revenue, the most in history by a women's college basketball team. [ 276 ] At the 2024 NCAA tournament, Clark's final three games each broke the women's college basketball viewership record, culminating with 18.9 million viewers for the national championship game . It was the most-viewed basketball game at any level since 2019 and the first women's NCAA tournament final to draw more viewers than the men's final. [ 277 ] [ 278 ] In her first WNBA season with the Indiana Fever , she continued to drive historic attendance and viewership. [ 279 ] The Fever set a franchise single-season attendance record, and their regular season finale set the league attendance record (20,711).

[ 1 ] Together with the junior Brazilian team, she won the bronze medal at the Under-19 World Championship in 2011, Chile , and was named Most Valuable Player at that tournament. [ 2 ] That same year, Dantas was also champion of the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship for Women with the senior national team , [ 3 ] and won a bronze medal at the 2011 Pan American Games . [ 4 ] Dantas began to play basketball at Janeth Arcain 's basketball institute at the age of 13. Within four years, she had become a professional. [ 5 ] Dantas played for Ourinhos in 2012, Maranhão in 2013, and Americana in 2013-2015. [ 6 ] WNBA [ edit ] Minnesota Lynx (2014-2015) [ edit ] Dantas was drafted by the Minnesota Lynx in the First Round of the 2012 WNBA draft - 12th Overall. Dantas was not expected to play in the WNBA until after the 2012 Olympic Games . [ 7 ] She was signed by the Lynx on April 2, 2014. [ 8 ] Dantas made her WNBA debut on May 16, 2014, gathering 12 rebounds in a win against Washington . [ 9 ] Dantas became the second rookie in league history to debut with 10 rebounds and 5 assists.

[ 11 ] Atlanta Dream (2015 and 2017) [ edit ] On July 27, 2015, Dantas was traded to the Atlanta Dream as part of the three-team deal. [ 12 ] She was suspended for the 2016 WNBA season after she failed to report to training camp, instead using the time to train with the Brazilian National team for the 2016 Summer Olympics that the country would host in Rio de Janeiro. [ 13 ] Atlanta retained Dantas's rights and they expected her to play with the team during the 2017 season. Minnesota Lynx (2019-2023) [ edit ] On February 8, 2019, Dantas signed with the Minnesota Lynx as a free agent. [ 14 ] Dantas missed several games in 2019 due to a calf injury. [ 15 ] In 2019, Dantas started all 26 games she played in and recorded career-highs in minutes, points, and assists per game.

[ 16 ] Dantas showed up in 2020 for the Lynx as they played in the WNBA Bubble. Over the 22-game campaign, Dantas shot 44.3% from three-point on just over four attempts beyond the arc per game, cementing her spot as one of the WNBA's elite-shooting bigs. She finished the season with averages of 12.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. [ 17 ] Dantas and the Lynx agreed to a multi-year extension in September 2020 after she completed one of her best years in the WNBA. Coach Cheryl Reeve stated that, ""Damiris has been such an important part of the Lynx culture since she first became a member of our organization in 2014...She has made great strides as a player over the last couple of years and remains an important element in our path forward."" [ 18 ] In one of the final games of the 2021 season, Dantas suffered a Lisfranc injury in her right foot, forcing her to end her season early and undergo surgery. [ 19 ] The extensive recovery time led to her developing a depression that led to lesser results and ultimately a nervous breakdown at the fifteenth game of the 2022 season. After discussing with Reeve, the coach agreed Dantas was not mentally well to continue playing, sidelining her to spend time with rest and psychological treatment. Dantas attended the Lynx training camp in 2023, ending up waived. To compensate her absence in the WNBA, Dantas led the Brazilian team to the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup title and played in both Mexico for Fuerza Regia and Turkey for Ormanspor .

[ 22 ] Dantas had to miss the opening week of training camp due to an issue with her visa and a family emergency. She returned to Indianapolis for the second week of camp, but a knee injury prevented her from training with the team. The Fever suspended her contract while she recovered from her injury.

She is widely considered one of the greatest three-point shooters in the WNBA. She is a four-time WNBA All-Star and All-WNBA Team selection, and an Olympic gold medalist with the United States national team . Ionescu played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks , where she twice won the John R. Wooden Award and Wade Trophy , earning consensus national player of the year honors as a senior. She set the Division I career triple-doubles record and is the Pac-12 Conference all-time leader in assists. Regarded as one of the greatest collegiate players in history, Ionescu was selected first overall by the New York Liberty in the 2020 WNBA draft . In 2023 , she broke the WNBA single-season record in three-pointers and the WNBA Three-Point Contest record. She led the Liberty to their first league championship in the following year. Early life [ edit ] Ionescu was born in Walnut Creek, California , to Romanian-American parents. Her father, Dan Ionescu, escaped communist Romania around the time of the 1989 revolution , seeking political asylum in the United States. He hoped that his then-wife, Liliana Blaj, and their son Andrei could join them in a few months, but they were unable to move to the US until 1995. [ 2 ] By that time, Dan owned a limousine service in Northern California , where he had chosen to settle because he had several extended family members in that area. [ 2 ] Sabrina was around three years old when she first picked up a basketball. She has a twin brother Edward (""Eddy""), who was born 18 minutes after her. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Eddy played basketball at the City College of San Francisco before transferring to Oregon; he was solely a student in the 2018-19 school year [ 5 ] before walking on to the Ducks men's basketball team in 2019-20. Sabrina Ionescu grew up in a Romanian-speaking household. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In a 2019 interview with Ava Wallace of The Washington Post , Ionescu admitted to being a ""natural scorer"", but said that most of the rest of her skill set came from playing alongside both boys and older girls in her childhood: [ 8 ] When I was younger, I was always playing with the guys, and I had to find ways to get the ball, because they never wanted to pass to me. So I figured that if I could rebound, I would be able to get the ball myself. Then passing-wise, when I was in sixth grade playing with the eighth-grade team, I was obviously a lot shorter, skinnier, smaller than they were. I would just have to find ways to impact the game other than shooting or scoring, and that was passing. Ionescu attended a middle school that did not have enough players to field a girls' team, and her school refused to allow her to play on the boys' team. She recalled, ""My middle school said I should be playing with dolls . Seriously, word-for-word."" She responded by recruiting enough girls to enable her school to have a team. [ 8 ] High school [ edit ] Sabrina Ionescu as MVP of the 2016 McDonald's All-American Girls Game Ionescu was a four-year varsity basketball letter winner at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California under head coach Kelly Sopak. [ 9 ] As a freshman in 2012-13, she started 14 of 29 games and averaged 13.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.9 steals per game to help her team to a 27-3 record and a Northern California Section Division II runner-up finish. As a sophomore in 2013-14, Ionescu helped her team to a 30-2 record. [ 10 ] During her junior year , Ionescu averaged 18.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 4.7 steals per game, and helped Miramonte High School to a 30-2 record with an appearance in the CIF open division semifinals. In her senior year , she led Miramonte to the CIF open division title game after averaging 25.3 points, 8.8 assists, 7.6 rebounds, 4.5 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. She posted a triple-double in the championship game loss to Chaminade with 24 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds. [ 11 ] Ionescu also made a first half buzzer-beating shot from half court. She received national honors including the USA Today Girls Basketball Player of the Year, Max Preps Player of the Year, Cal-Hi Sports Ms. Basketball State Player of the Year and Gatorade State Player of the Year. [ 12 ] Ionescu was named a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand All-American selection. She was named the McDonald's All-America game MVP after scoring a record 25 points, including seven three-pointers, with 10 rebounds. [ 13 ] Ionescu left Miramonte with a career win-loss record of 119-9 and a school-record 2,606 points scored. She is also the all-time leader in assists (769), steals (549) and triple-doubles (21). In addition to the career record, Ionescu also held the Miramonte top three single-season scoring records with 598 (2013-14), 760 (2014-15) and 834 (2015-16). Ionescu also held the single-game scoring record of 43 points vs. Pinewood High School while being double- and triple-teamed and the single-game record in assists with 19 at Dublin High School. [ citation needed ] Ionescu was the No. 1 ranked point guard and No. 4 overall player in the recruiting class of 2016. [ 14 ] According to Ava Wallace of The Washington Post , Ionescu chose Oregon ""because she wanted to be the all-American at Oregon, not just an all-American somewhere else."" At the time, she was the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to Oregon basketball. [ 8 ] However, she had difficulty making a college choice, not signing a National Letter of Intent with any school during either the early signing period in November 2015 or the late period in April 2016. Ionescu finally committed to Oregon just before the school's 2016 summer term began, driving with her father for 8 hours from their Bay Area home to Eugene , making an unannounced visit to Matthew Knight Arena and telling head coach Kelly Graves that she would join the team. [ 2 ] College career [ edit ] Freshman season [ edit ] On November 13, 2016, Ionescu made her collegiate debut for Oregon, recording 11 points in an 84-67 win over Lamar. Ionescu recorded four triple-doubles, one shy of the Pac-12 record and two less than the NCAA record. She averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, ranking second on the team in scoring and rebounding, and first in assists. She also posted seven double-doubles, ranked third in the Pac-12 and 29th in the NCAA with 183 assists on the year. Her 1.93-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was second-best in the Pac-12. She was named Pac-12 Freshman of Week four times and was named USBWA National Player of the Week. At the end of the regular season, she was named Pac-12 Freshmen of the Year and unanimous First Team All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 All-Freshman Team selection. Additionally, she was awarded the USBWA National Freshman of the Year presented by the United States Basketball Writers Association. [ 15 ] Sophomore season [ edit ] Ionescu rose to national prominence in her sophomore year, leading the Ducks to their third regular-season league crown all-time and first-ever No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Women's Basketball Tournament. She led the Pac-12 in scoring (19.2) and assists, dishing out 7.8 assists per game which was fifth-most in the country. She had 16 double-doubles this season and 14 20-point games. She recorded 10-assist games 13 times this season, handing out a league season-high 14 twice. On February 26, 2018, Ionescu was named ESPNW's college basketball player of the week. [ 16 ] Following her second season, she was named the Pac-12 Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year , and was also named a first team All-American by ESPN . Oregon also won the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2000. She was named the winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top Division I women's point guard after the season, [ 17 ] and was also a finalist for the Naismith Award . [ 18 ] Ionescu became the NCAA women's all-time leader in triple-doubles , [ 19 ] trailing only former BYU men's player Kyle Collinsworth (with 12) among all NCAA players. [ 20 ] Junior season [ edit ] Sabrina Ionescu at the 2019 Pac-12 Tournament. On November 6, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 11th triple-double in a victory against Alaska-Fairbanks. [ 21 ] Twelve days later, she would tie the NCAA triple-double record, with her 12th triple-double in a win against Buffalo. [ 22 ] On December 20, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 13th triple-double in a game against Air Force and broke the NCAA triple-double record for both men's and women's basketball. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] She was later named ESPNW Player of the Week. [ 25 ] Since that game, Ionescu added five more triple-doubles for a season total of eighteen and broke the Oregon women's basketball assist record (formerly 608 assists) in a Pac-12 conference game against USC. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Ionescu led the Ducks to their first Final Four appearance after a 88-84 victory over Mississippi State. [ 29 ] Ionescu finished the game with 31 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and a steal. In the Final Four, the Ducks lost to the eventual national champion Baylor 72-67. Ionescu won John R. Wooden Award and the Wade Trophy as the best women's college basketball player in NCAA Division I. Despite having only played for three seasons, Ionescu was eligible for the 2019 WNBA draft by age. Additionally, she would receive her bachelor's degree that June. [ 30 ] However, believing that she had ""unfinished business"" at Oregon, she chose to come back for her senior season. [ 31 ] This announcement came shortly after Ionescu accepted a place in a newly launched one-year master's degree program in brand creation in Oregon's School of Journalism and Communications. [ 32 ] Senior season [ edit ] In the second game of her senior season on November 13, 2019, Ionescu surpassed the 2,000 points, 800 assists mark for her college career with a 109-52 win over Utah State. She fell short of another triple-double with 16 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds in the game but recorded her 2,012th career point and 810th career assist. [ 33 ] In a win over then #3 Stanford (87-55), Ionescu scored a career high 37 points along with 11 rebounds and 7 assists, and broke Alison Lang 's Oregon all-time career scoring record of 2,252 points in the third quarter. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In the rivalry game against Oregon State on January 24, 2020, Ionescu had 24 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds and broke Oregon State and NBA star Gary Payton 's Pac-12 all-time record of 938 assists. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Payton personally congratulated Ionescu on the achievement. [ 38 ] On February 14, 2020, Ionescu recorded her 1,000th career assist in a game against #7 UCLA and joined Courtney Vandersloot as the only players in NCAA men's and women's basketball history with 2,000 plus points and 1,000 plus assists. [ 39 ] Ten days later in the Ducks' 74-66 win at #4 Stanford , she became the first NCAA player ever with 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. Ionescu also recorded her eighth triple-double of the season, tying her own NCAA single-season record from the previous season. Earlier that day, she had been a featured speaker at the memorial service for Kobe Bryant [ 40 ] , who had become a close personal friend within the previous two years, flying from Los Angeles to the Bay Area immediately after her speech. [ 41 ] On April 14, 2020, Ionescu was named the winner of the Honda Sports Award as the best collegiate female basketball player in the nation. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Ionescu won the AP Player of the Year , Naismith College Player of the Year , USBWA National Player of the Year and the John R. Wooden Award and the Wade Trophy . Ionescu received the Nancy Lieberman award for her third straight season. Impact at Oregon [ edit ] According to Ducks coach Kelly Graves , in 2019 Ionescu had ""a chance to be a Marcus Mariota , that level of player and an esteemed Oregon Duck when it's all said and done."" He noted that attendance at Oregon women's games had dramatically increased during Ionescu's career at the school. In the season before she arrived , the average announced home attendance for the Ducks was 1,501. Her sophomore season saw an average attendance of over 4,200; it went up to over 7,100 in her junior season and over 10,000 in her senior season. [ 30 ] Ionescu was also a significant draw when Oregon went on the road; for example, when the Ducks visited Washington during her junior season, the crowd for that game was 3,000 more than the Huskies drew two nights earlier against Oregon State . [ 8 ] Graves' remarks about Ionescu's future iconic status at Oregon proved to be prophetic. Shortly after the premature end of her senior season (caused by the COVID-19 pandemic ), the university polled fans on social media, asking them to name the four Oregon alumni they would put on a national Mount Rushmore for the university. According to a 2020 story in the university's web journal Around the O , more than 70 suggestions were provided, but the four top choices were Mariota, Steve Prefontaine , Phil Knight , and Ionescu. As the story's author Damian Foley put it, Yes, Sabrina Elaine Ionescu, who only earned her diploma in 2019, is considered by UO fans to be one of the four greatest Ducks ever , standing alongside such greats as Marcus Mariota, Steve Prefontaine, and the alumnus who co-founded Nike and made the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact possible. [ 30 ] Professional career [ edit ] WNBA [ edit ] New York Liberty (2020-present) [ edit ] Ionescu with the New York Liberty in 2022 Ionescu turned 22 in December 2019, making her eligible to declare for the 2019 WNBA draft . A January 2019 mock draft by ESPN , incorporating input from WNBA personnel and ESPN women's basketball analysts, concluded that Ionescu was a possible top pick should she declare. [ 44 ] However, Ionescu announced in an open letter published in The Players' Tribune on April 6, 2019, the day after Oregon's loss to Baylor in the Final Four and four days before the draft, that she would return to Oregon for her senior season. [ 31 ] On April 17, 2020, the New York Liberty selected Ionescu with the first overall pick in the 2020 WNBA draft . [ 45 ] She played her first game with the Liberty on July 25. In her second WNBA game on July 29 against the Dallas Wings , she recorded 33 points, 7 assists, and 7 rebounds in 34 minutes of play. [ 46 ] On August 1, 2020, Ionescu injured her left ankle in the second quarter against the Atlanta Dream . She was diagnosed the next day with a [ 47 ] grade 3 sprain , and was expected to miss about one month while recovering. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In the end, though, she did not play again for the remainder of her first professional season. [ 47 ] She complained about not being able to be considered a rookie in her second season of playing in the WNBA even though she played two games in her first season. [ 50 ] Sabrina Ionescu on the court for the NY Liberty, September 29, 2024 The next season, on May 18, 2021, Ionescu recorded her first professional triple-double in her 6th career game. She scored 26 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds, she became the fastest player in WNBA history to record a triple double. [ 51 ] It was also the first Liberty triple-double, as well as the tenth in league history. [ 52 ] On July 6, 2022, Ionescu had 31 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists to record the first 30-point triple-double in WNBA history. [ 53 ] Ionecscu and the Liberty advanced to the WNBA Finals in consecutive seasons ( 2023 and 2024 ). They were defeated by the Las Vegas Aces in 2023, 3 games to 1. [ 54 ] The following season, they matched up against the Minnesota Lynx . In game 3 against Minnesota, Ionescu scored the game-winning three-pointer to give the Liberty a 2-1 series lead. [ 55 ] In the fifth game, she had a bad night shooting the ball, but she contributed leading Liberty with 8 assists and 7 rebounds, 6 of which were defensive, in addition to 2 steals and 1 block in the fifth game, helping the team win its first championship in the history of the franchise. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Unrivaled [ edit ] Phantom BC (2025-present) [ edit ] On December 23, 2024, Ionescu was announced as the final roster spot for the inaugural 2025 season of Unrivaled , the women's 3-on-3 basketball league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart , signing a deal that ""puts her in a category of her own"" within the league. [ 58 ] Ionescu signed with Phantom BC , joining her former college teammate, Satou Sabally , and filling the club's final wildcard spot. [ 59 ] Three-point contests [ edit ] On July 14, 2023, Ionescu scored 37 points in the Three-Point Contest , the highest in WNBA history, making 25 of her final 27 shots. [ 60 ] Stephen Curry holds the NBA record of 31 points . The three-point contest is not a unified record between WNBA and NBA, as the shooting distance and ball sizes are not equal. [ 61 ] On February 17, 2024, Ionescu competed against Stephen Curry in a three-point contest during the NBA All-Star Weekend . [ 62 ] She scored 26 against Curry's 29 points. [ 63 ] Ionescu was invited to participate in the 2024 contest , but declined the offer. [ 64 ] On July 16, 2025, the contestants for the 2025 three-point contest were announced, which included Ionescu. [ 65 ] She went on to win the competition on July 18, hitting 11 shots in a row with a score of 30 in the final round. [ 66 ] In the press conference afterwards, Ionescu said that prior to the competition she had promised rookie, Sonia Citron , half of her prize money if she won and that she would be keeping that promise. [ 66 ] Ionescu stated the other half of her winnings would go to her SI20 Foundation. [ 66 ] Off the court [ edit ] Ionescu at the New York Liberty championship parade in 2024 On April 17, 2020, Ionescu signed an endorsement deal with Nike , which will include signature footwear and apparel. [ 67 ] On September 1, 2023, the Nike Sabrina 1's were released as her first signature shoe. [ 68 ] On November 11, 2022, she rejoined her alma mater, Oregon, as the director of athletic culture. [ 69 ] On November 14, 2022, she was ranked in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Sports. [ 70 ] Since 2022, Ionescu has hosted the Sabrina Ionescu Showcase for girls basketball teams in the Bay Area. Most recently these games have been hosted at all-girls high school Carondolet, where her former coach Kelly Sopak now coaches, and its brother school, De La Salle. [ 71 ] Her second signature shoe with Nike, the Sabrina 2, debuted in the summer of 2024. [ 72 ] National team career [ edit ] 3x3 basketball [ edit ] In late April 2018, Ionescu and Oregon teammates Erin Boley, Otiona Gildon, and Ruthy Hebard entered the USA Basketball women's national 3x3 championship tournament at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado . [ 73 ] Ionescu had never before played under FIBA 3x3 rules, admitting after the tournament, ""I had to ask the rules before the games started."" [ 74 ] She adjusted quickly to the unfamiliar format, leading her team to the championship while going unbeaten and also being named tournament MVP. [ 73 ] Ionescu and her Oregon teammates would be named as the US team for the 2018 3x3 World Cup to be held in June in the Philippines . [ 75 ] At the World Cup, they were the youngest team in the field, but swept their pool, defeating Cup holders Russia along the way. [ 76 ] They finished 5th. 2024 Summer Olympics [ edit ] In June 2024, Ionescu was named to the US women's Olympic team to compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in France alongside fellow New York Liberty teammate, Breanna Stewart . [ 77 ] Ionescu and the United States defeated France 67-66 in the final , earning Ionescu her first Olympic gold medal and the United States' eighth consecutive gold medal.

Early life [ edit ] Stewart was born Breanna Mackenzie Baldwin in Syracuse, New York , to a single mother, Heather Baldwin. Her biological father was not involved in her life, and her mother worked multiple jobs to support herself and her daughter. When Stewart was a toddler, her mother began dating Brian Stewart, who later adopted Stewart after marrying Baldwin. She has a younger half-brother, Connor. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Stewart began playing basketball at an early age. Due to her height her coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder, but her father encouraged her to practice ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. She started a daily routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones, for a mile. [ 17 ] Her routine improved her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. In a 2017 essay in The Players' Tribune , Stewart publicly revealed that she had been a victim of sexual abuse from age 9 to 11. She reported the abuse to her parents, who immediately called police. [ 18 ] The perpetrator, who was married to her maternal aunt, confessed to the abuse and ultimately served prison time. [ 16 ] [ 18 ] High school [ edit ] Stewart attended Cicero-North Syracuse High School (C-NS) in Cicero , where she played for head coach Eric Smith. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] She was nicknamed ""Bean"" by her teammates, and ""6-10"" because of her wingspan. [ 21 ] Stewart first played for the high school team while still in eighth grade. She played as a starter in most games, and averaged nine points, almost nine rebounds and seven blocks per game. In her freshman year, she almost doubled her point production, scoring 17 points per game. That year, her team had a 21-3 record, and made it to the regional final game. [ 22 ] In her sophomore year, she was a starter in every game, and upped her scoring average to 22 points per game. In that year, her team's record was 18-4. As a junior, she helped lead her team to the state AA public school title, with a 22-3 record for the year. Stewart averaged 24 points and 15 rebounds for the season. [ 22 ] During her junior year, she announced that she would be attending the University of Connecticut . The day after the announcement, she dunked the ball in a game against Baldwinsville , her first career dunk. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Stewart achieved a milestone on January 31, 2012, when she scored her 2,000th point, as part of a 31-0 run against Auburn . [ 25 ] Stewart was selected as a member of the 2012 McDonald's All-American team, which represented the 24 best female high school basketball players. The selected players were grouped into two squads that competed in the annual McDonald's All-American Game , held that year in Chicago . [ 26 ] Stewart was selected to the 2012 Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) High School Coaches' All-America Team. The top 20 high school players in the country were named as WBCA All-Americans and were eligible to play in the all-star game. She participated in the 2012 WBCA High School All-America Game, scoring 10 points. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Stewart was named the 2012 Naismith High School Girls' Player of the Year, the honor awarded by the Atlanta Tipoff Club to the best female high school basketball player in the country. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In March 2012, in a surprise presentation by Tamika Catchings , Stewart received the Gatorade National Girls Basketball Player of the Year award. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Stewart was one of six finalists for the Gatorade High School Athlete of the Year. [ 33 ] High school tournaments [ edit ] In addition to regularly scheduled post-season tournaments, the success of her high school team led to invitations to prominent national tournaments. In 2010, the C-NS team traveled to Philadelphia , New Jersey and Disney World; [ 34 ] in 2011, the team went to the Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix, Arizona , considered the ""premier showcase of all high school girls tournaments""; [ 34 ] [ 35 ] and in 2012, the Northstars played in a Basketball Hall of Fame Tournament in Springfield, Massachusetts . [ 34 ] [ 36 ] Tournament of Champions [ edit ] Breanna Stewart at the 2012 Hoophall Classic The Tournament of Champions is an annual event, since 1997, showcasing the best high school girls basketball teams. [ 37 ] The 2011 event, held in Phoenix, Arizona , included 96 of the best basketball programs in the country. [ 35 ] The C-NS team was assigned to the Smith Division, where they faced Bolingbrook High School , considered to be the number 1 team by USA Today . [ 38 ] Despite being viewed as a 30-point underdog, Stewart helped her team to the first round upset, scoring 15 points in a 43-40 win. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In the quarter-final game, Stewart scored 29 points and had 19 rebounds to help the team beat the number 22 ranked team in the country, Dr. Phillips High School from Orlando, Florida . Although double-teamed, she scored ten points in a 12-0 run that gave C-NS a commanding 23-point lead early in the fourth quarter. [ 41 ] That win secured a place in the semi-finals of the division. In the semi-final game, C-NS faced St. Mary's, the number 2 ranked team in the country. Stewart had 33 points and 16 rebounds, but it was not enough to overcome the scoring of the eventual champion of the tournament. [ 42 ] Although the team lost that game, Stewart's overall performance earned her the most outstanding player of the tournament honors. [ 43 ] Stewart was viewed as an offensive threat in the low post, high post and perimeter, and was effective as a defender because of her long wingspan. [ 44 ] 2012 Hoophall Classic [ edit ] Stewart's Northstars team were invited to play in the annual Hoophall Classic; the event was held in Springfield, Massachusetts, and typically featured some of the best high school teams in the country. Their opponents were the local West Springfield team, not nationally ranked, but 8-0 at the time of the meeting. The result was not close, as C-NS beat West Springfield 60-20, with Stewart alone scoring more points than the opposition. Stewart ended the game with 22 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks, despite leaving the game in the third period and not returning. Her performance earned her the Most Outstanding Player award for the event. [ 36 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] College career [ edit ] Stewart was recruited by many schools, but after a campus visit to UConn in 2011, she told the coaching staff, ""I would like to commit if you'd take me."" [ 47 ] Stewart signed her commitment letter on the hood of her car, then gave it to her father at his office to fax to the school. [ 47 ] Freshman year [ edit ] Stewart started her freshman year in strong form, scoring at least 20 points in three of her first four games. She scored a total of 169 points in her first ten games, which broke Maya Moore 's record for most points in a player's first 10 career games. [ 48 ] However, her output slowed, and her scoring average dropped below ten points for her last eighteen regular season games. [ 49 ] In March 2013, she started early morning sessions with Chris Dailey, associate head coach, to concentrate on shooting and post moves. [ 50 ] She came back strong in the Big East tournament, with a total of 51 points, matching the number scored by Diana Taurasi in her tournament debut. Her strong performance continued in the NCAA tournament. [ 49 ] She did not play in the first round, due to a calf injury, but scored 105 points in the last five games, earning her the award of the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, the first freshman to win the award since 1987. [ 51 ] Sophomore year [ edit ] Stewart receiving the Wade Trophy in 2015. Stewart continued her stellar play in her sophomore year ; her coaches noticed that she was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally did as a freshman, but usually only if she thought she was playing well. [ 17 ] By the end of her sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference , which she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year , only the third time in history it went to a sophomore. [ 52 ] Stewart started and played in all [ 53 ] 40 games of 2013-2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per game, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn history.

[ 4 ] [ 3 ] As a child, she also played Little League Baseball as a catcher , as well as football and soccer , but focused on basketball by first grade.

[ 58 ] College career [ edit ] Freshman season [ edit ] Entering her freshman season at UConn , sports publications described Bueckers as the program's most hyped recruit since Breanna Stewart in 2012. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Unlike Stewart and other former UConn stars, she became her team's leader from the beginning of her college career. [ 63 ] Megan Walker , UConn 's top scorer from the previous year, had opted to forgo her senior season to enter the 2020 WNBA draft , leaving the 2020-21 team with no seniors. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Bueckers was unanimously selected as the Big East Preseason Freshman of the Year by the league's coaches. [ 66 ] ""I think the most impressive thing about Paige is that she plays at the same pace the entire game. That usually comes a bit later for most players, but she's got it at such a young age. She makes the game slow down for her. I'm always surprised when she shoots and it doesn't go in."" - UConn head coach Geno Auriemma on Bueckers after her 31-point game in a win over No. 1 South Carolina on February 8, 2021 [ 67 ] On December 12, 2020, Bueckers made her collegiate debut for UConn , recording 17 points, nine rebounds, five assists and five steals in a 79-23 win over UMass Lowell .

Selected by the Wings with the second overall pick in the 2021 WNBA draft , she was the second Finnish player in the history of the league after Taru Tuukkanen to be drafted, and she became the first Finnish player to play in the WNBA in May 2021. [ 7 ] Career [ edit ] Peli-Karhut (2016-2017) [ edit ] Growing up in the city of Kotka , Kuier was discovered for basketball by a neighbour at age 10, when she stood already 180 cm tall. The man contacted Mikko Kokkola, who was coaching basketball at the local Peli-Karhut [ fi ] , and Kokkola invited her to practice. [ 8 ] Kuier joined the club. She was named the U16-league Player of the Season in 2015-16. She debuted in top-tier Naisten Korisliiga with PeKa first team in the 2016-17 season.

[ 14 ] In addition to her speed and resilience, Kuier's features also include an exceptionally large wingspan of about seven feet. [ 15 ] On 10 June 2022, in a game against the Seattle Storm , Kuier became the 8th woman in WNBA history to dunk a basketball. [ 16 ] On 22 January 2024, Kuier announced that she would skip the 2024 WNBA season . [ 3 ] This is due to overlapping seasons between Italy and the United States, and the strict change in WNBA rules concerning absences related to playing in Europe. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Kuier has stated that her dream is to compete in the EuroLeague Women . Reyer Venezia (2022-2025) [ edit ] Since June 2022, Reyer has also played for Italian team Reyer Venezia during winter seasons in Europe, competing in Lega Basket Femminile and EuroCup . In May 2024, Kuier helped Reyer Venezia to win the Italian championship title. She was also named the Finals MVP with her 24-point performance in the decisive third final match.

She played her collegiate basketball for the UConn Huskies of the Big East Conference . [ 3 ] She previously played for the Fairfield Stags and was named MAAC Player of the Year as a senior. [ 4 ] She was selected 5th overall in the 2023 WNBA draft by the Dallas Wings . Early life [ edit ] Lopez Sénéchal was born in Guadalajara, Mexico . Her father Carlos Lopez is Mexican and her mother Sophie Sénéchal is French. [ 5 ] Her parents separated when she was five. She moved to Grenoble, France with her mother while her father remained in Mexico. [ 6 ] She had grown up playing soccer but she tried basketball for the first time at the age of eight. With her soccer experience she had no problem with her legs, but using her hands to dribble was new. But this was the first time she truly felt at home while in France, because the sport was new to everyone in the class so she no longer ""felt like an outsider. On the basketball court, she felt like an equal."" [ 7 ] She attended high school in France but in 2017-18, she played basketball at the North Atlantic Basketball Academy in Ireland. While she was playing in Ireland, she had a chance conversation with a friend. Her friend remarked ""I'm going to Canada to play college basketball"". Until that conversation, she had never considered the possibility of playing in the Americas, but after the conversation it was all she could think about. [ 7 ] Along with her stepfather, she communicated with schools throughout the US. With help from her stepdad, they reached out to two hundred and eighty schools in both Division I and Division II. The only schools they didn't consider were those ranked in the top twenty-five, which at the time seemed too much of a stretch. [ 7 ] They received some responses, so the family scheduled a trip to the States that offered for scholarships. The schools included UMass Lowell , Tulsa , Akron , Duquesne and Fairfield . The head coach at Fairfield, Joe Frager, planned a 45-minute workout to see what she could do. After only 10 minutes he indicated that the workout was over. She asked him what she had done wrong, he responded that she had done everything right. He had seen plenty of game film but wanted to see her in action to assess her personal attributes. He concluded she was open to being coached. Lopez Sénéchal accepted the offer and enrolled at Fairfield. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] College career [ edit ] Fairfield [ edit ] Lopez Sénéchal played for four years and graduated from Fairfield University before transferring to UConn . [ 3 ] She is 6-foot-1in tall and plays wing. [ 3 ] In her freshman year, she sat for an interview with the Fairfield Mirror , the student newspaper at the school. She discussed the challenges of adapting to college in the United States after living in France most of her life. She played basketball in France and Ireland, and noted that her teammates and friends were typically 25 years old or older, while she was now playing with teammates closer to her age. [ 11 ] By her senior year she was being described as ""arguably the conference's best offensive player"". That description followed a 26 point performance against Quinnipiac, leading to ""a convincing 72-60 win"" by Fairfield over Quinnipiac on their home floor. [ 12 ] At the time, Quinnipiac was the five-time regular-season champion of the MAAC. [ 13 ] At Fairfield, she led the team to an appearance in the NCAA tournament . [ 14 ] Before the season started, the head coach of Fairfield, Joe Frager, had announced his retirement as of the end of the season. The team, led by Lopez Sénéchal, helped extend that retirement date as long as possible, winning their first conference title since 1998. That automatically qualified them for an NCAA tournament bid, their first such bid since 2001. They were seeded 15th and faced second seed Texas , ranked seventh in the country. They arrived in Austin two days before the game and met for a team dinner, with players pointing out that it was the first such team dinner in a restaurant for two years due to COVID restrictions. [ 15 ] In the first quarter of the game against Texas, the elbow of Texas's Lauren Ebo connected with Lopez Sénéchal's face. [ 16 ] Ebo went to the foul line with the score 12-8 in favor of Texas. Lopez Sénéchal had to go to the locker room, where she received two stitches to close a cut. [ 17 ] She did not play the remainder of the first half. She returned in the second half and almost immediately hit a three pointer. [ 18 ] Texas won this first round match by a score of 70 to 52. UConn [ edit ] When Morgan Valley saw Lopez Sénéchal's name in the NCAA transfer portal , she had already heard the name ""dozens of times"". Fairfield is only an hour and 1/2 drive from the UConn campus, and Valley had discussions with a coach of a competing team about the challenges of stopping Lopez Sénéchal. When Valley saw the name in the portal, she immediately began doing some research viewing game films and reaching out to the Fairfield head coach, Joe Frager, to find out whether she would be a fit at UConn. Frager, who has known UConn coach Geno Auriemma for decades, ""understood the demands of the Huskies program"" and responded that she would be ""more than fine at UConn"". Valley shared the video clips with Auriemma and the rest of the UConn staff which led to zoom meetings with Lopez Sénéchal while the UConn coaches were in Minneapolis for the Final Four. [ 19 ] At Fairfield, virtually all the scoring plays were run through her. The initial expectations were that Lopez Sénéchal would play more of a reserve role, and it was important that she feel comfortable with this change. Her goals were to get a shot at playing pro, and she felt that even a reduced role at UConn would provide the visibility and competition that would help earn a spot on a WNBA roster. While Auriemma originally expected her to get some minutes, he upgraded his opinion after a few days of practice. ""After the first five days, I pretty much said, 'Someone who was a starter isn't going to start this year, ' "" Auriemma said. ""That's how impressive she was."" With star guards Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd injured during Lopez Sénéchal's final year at UConn, Lou became one of the team's top scorers, helping to carry the team all the way to the Final Four. She played over thirty minutes a game during the season and established herself as one of the leading shooting guards in the country. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Professional Career [ edit ] The Dallas Wings selected Lopez Senechal during the 2023 WNBA Draft with the fifth overall pick. However, she did not play during the 2023 season due to a knee injury. She played during the 2024 season but saw limited minutes behind several other guards. She decided not to play during the 2025 season due to personal reasons.

[ 71 ] In February 2024, Wilson published her first book, Dear Black Girls , [ 72 ] which became a The New York Times best seller that same month. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Commentary on racial bias in marketing of female athletes [ edit ] Days after the announcement of Wilson's signature shoe, the A'One, with Nike , [ 75 ] Wilson, in an interview with the Associated Press , agreed when asked, that white female athletes (including Indiana Fever rookie, Caitlin Clark ) are often perceived as more marketable than black female athletes. [ 76 ] She alluded to her own experience of needing incredible success in the WNBA before garnering high-level sponsorship and business deals (such as a signature shoe) as a black woman: ""[corporations] don't see [people of color] as marketable, so it doesn't matter how hard I work. It doesn't matter what we all do as black women."" [ 77 ] Wilson's comments were made in light of recent reports from The Wall Street Journal and The Athletic that Clark and Nike were in negotiations for an eight-figure endorsement deal, including a signature shoe, [ 78 ] effectively making Clark the fifth Caucasian active player in the WNBA (joining Elena Delle Donne , Diana Taurasi , Sabrina Ionescu , and Breanna Stewart ) with a signature shoe. [ 79 ] Before this Nike-Clark deal was reported, many fans, reporters, and fellow athletes had been asking for Nike to give Wilson a signature shoe, including Aces' head coach, Becky Hammon, and NBA star, LeBron James , [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] given her accolades and exceptional performance in the WNBA and long-standing sponsorship with Nike. [ 49 ] [ 83 ] On May 14, 2024, during the press conference before her professional debut in the WNBA, Clark was asked by Fox News Digital to respond to Wilson's commentary on Clark's rapid rise in popularity in relation to her race and stated, ""I think there [are] opportunities for every single player in women's basketball ... the more opportunities we can give across the board, that's what's going to elevate women's basketball."" [ 79 ] She continued and added, ""The parity in women's basketball is what's making more people want to come watch it. ... I've had a lot of fun being in the spotlight and helping grow this game and move it forward, and that's what I'm going to continue to do ... the more we can share the love, the better this league's going to be.""

[ 16 ] The Lynx welcomed Pili to the team with an event introducing her to local members of Indigenous and Polynesian communities, including the Minnesota Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan and former Vikings player Esera Tuaolo . [ 17 ] In the 2024 preseason, Pili scored 10 points with 2 assists and 3 rebounds in the Lynx game on May 8, 2024, against the Washington Mystics. [ 18 ] Pili made her WNBA debut in the Lynx game against the Seattle Storm at Climate Pledge Arena on May 14, 2024. She played 10 minutes and had one rebound.

[ 32 ] Proceeds from items in the collection benefit the N7 Fund ""to provide sport and physical activity programming to kids in Native American and Aboriginal communities."" [ 32 ] Personal life [ edit ] In addition to her athletic success, Pili's Samoan and Indigenous heritage has made her a role model for others. Since college, she has attracted people with Samoan and Indigenous backgrounds to her games. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Her mother, Heather Pili, said, ""It gives a lot of hope to all of the natives in America. It's amazing to see. It's hard to describe being in that environment and seeing the crowds that she's drawing. It's pretty emotional."" [ 33 ] For the WNBA draft, Pili worked with designer Jason Vu on a dress that showcased her Samoan culture. [ 35 ] The dress used Samoan designs on the skirt, which had a slit to highlight the tribal tattoos on her right leg. The dress also was one shouldered to also highlight the tribal tattoos on her left shoulder. [ 35 ] During the draft, Pili was quoted as saying, ""A lot of Indigenous and Polynesian girls don't get to see that role model and I'm just so blessed to be in the position to be that for them...I'm representing them with pride. I had to include the tribal in my dress."" [ 36 ] More than 100 people of Samoan heritage attended Pili's first home game playing for the Minnesota Lynx to show their support for her. [ 37 ] Her older brother, Brandon , played football for USC as a defensive lineman , and currently plays for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League .

Nicknamed "" Plum Dawg "", she is a four-time WNBA All-Star and was named the WNBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2022. Plum won gold medals with the United States in 3x3 basketball in 2020 and in 5x5 basketball in 2024 . She is also the founder of the Dawg Class basketball camp. Born in Poway, California , Plum attended La Jolla Country Day School , where she was named a McDonald's All-American . She played college basketball at Washington , where she left as the NCAA Division I women's all-time leading scorer. In her senior season, Plum was named national player of the year and set the Division I single-season scoring record. She was selected first overall in the 2017 WNBA draft by the San Antonio Stars , later renamed the Las Vegas Aces . With the Aces, she won back-to-back WNBA championships in 2022 and 2023 and earned her first All-WNBA First Team selection in 2022. Early life [ edit ] Plum is the daughter of Katie and Jim Plum. [ 1 ] Her mother was an accomplished volleyball player for the University of California, Davis . [ 2 ] Her father earned All-American football honors and set the CIF San Diego Section career passing yardage mark at Helix High School in La Mesa, California , and went on to play football and baseball collegiately at San Diego State . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Plum has two older sisters and a younger brother. Her sisters both followed in their mother's footsteps and played volleyball. Her oldest sister Kaitlyn played for UC Davis, while Lauren played for the University of Oregon and for USA Volleyball 's Junior National Team. Her younger brother Daniel played football at UC Davis. [ citation needed ] She went through fourth grade at a local Montessori school, but Plum, who has dyslexia, was bullied by her classmates, and was young for her class, felt unprepared to advance. This led to a transfer to Midland Elementary, a public school. Her mother Katie thought repeating fourth grade could be useful, but she left the decision to her daughter, and she agreed. The decision to repeat fourth grade did not go perfectly, since she didn't like her teacher and her friends were in another class, so she asked to switch classes and was granted the request. However, even into high school, Plum felt like she didn't belong. She has now said she hopes anyone facing situations like hers knows they can also get through it. [ 5 ] Plum played volleyball at first, excelling in the USA Volleyball junior system, but when it came time for high school, she chose La Jolla Country Day School over Poway High School , where her sisters had attended, and Plum chose basketball over volleyball. [ 6 ] La Jolla Country Day School is where Candice Wiggins played during her high school years as well. [ 7 ] High school [ edit ] During the course of her high school career, Plum scored a total of 2,247 points, averaging 19.9 points per game. She recorded 677 rebounds, assisted on 381 baskets, and had 370 steals. [ 8 ] Over her four years, her team had a record of 103-22, which led to four section titles and the 2012 CIF Division IV state championship. [ 9 ] Plum also played AAU basketball for San Diego Sol. [ 10 ] Plum was selected to the 2013 WBCA High School Coaches' All-America Team. She participated in the 2013 WBCA High School All-America Game, hitting six of her eight field goal attempts, scoring 14 points. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] When it came time for college choices, Plum considered Maryland and Virginia on the east coast, and Cal, Gonzaga , Oregon and Washington on the west coast, then decided to accept the offer from Washington. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Plum was named a McDonald's All-American. [ 15 ] This qualified her to participate in the 2013 McDonald's All-American Girls Game . [ 16 ] She was named Ms. Basketball by CalHiSports, an honor bestowed upon the best female high school basketball player in California. Prior winners include Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis , Courtney Paris , Candice Wiggins , and Diana Taurasi . [ 2 ] College career [ edit ] Freshman year [ edit ] After Plum helped the USA basketball team to win the gold medal in Lithuania, she flew directly to Seattle rather than heading home to San Diego. A teammate at the University of Washington picked her up at the airport and they were in the gym by the end of the day. By going directly to campus, Plum was able to sign up for summer school classes and get acquainted with the university and her teammates before the fall quarter began. [ 7 ] Her head coach Mike Neighbors noticed her desire to get started, which helped him with his decision to name her the team captain before the season started, a rare event for a freshman. During her freshman year, she set six Washington freshman records. Her total points scored (695) were the most ever by a freshman, and her single game high of 38 points is a freshman record. She earned freshman of the year honors for the Pac-12 conference. She averaged almost 21 points per game during the regular season. One of the highlights of the year was a victory over the fourth ranked team in the country, Stanford . Plum was the high scorer with 23 points. [ 17 ] Sophomore year [ edit ] Washington opened their regular-season with a game against Oklahoma. Washington lost the game 90-80 but Plum set a new school record with 45 points. [ 18 ] In her sophomore year, she was named to the ""Wade Watch"" a list of 25 players who are viewed as having the potential to win player of the year honors. She was also named to the list of 30 players to be considered for the Wooden Award . [ 19 ] Plum helped the Washington Huskies earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament. In a coincidence, they faced Miami , coached by Katie Meier, who had been Plum's coach while on the USA Basketball U19 team. Plum scored 17 points in the game, but Miami prevailed 86-80. [ 20 ] Junior year [ edit ] For the week of January 11-17, Plum was named both the Ann Meyers Drysdale National Player of the Week and the Pac-12 Player of the Week. By scoring 25.9 points per game, she ranked first in the Pac-12 and fourth in the nation. Plum also led the Huskies on an improbable NCAA Tournament run, highlighted by their first Final Four appearance in program history. Unfortunately, the magical run ultimately ended in the Final Four as Plum and the Huskies lost to a deeper, more talented Syracuse Orange team (who also clinched their first Final Four berth in program history), 80-59. The Orange would go on to lose to the undefeated 37-0 and three-time defending women's national champions Connecticut Huskies , 82-51. Senior year [ edit ] During Plum's senior season , she became the all-time leading scorer for either gender in Pac-12 history, passing the former record of Stanford's Chiney Ogwumike in a December 11, 2016, win over Boise State . [ 21 ] The following month, during a win over Arizona , Plum became the first Pac-12 player, and the 12th NCAA Division I women's player, to reach 3,000 career points . [ 22 ] [ a ] On February 25, 2017, in the Huskies' final regular season game, Plum scored a Pac-12 record 57 points in an 84-77 win over Utah . The record-setting output also gave Plum the NCAA Division I women's basketball career scoring record . She entered the game trailing Jackie Stiles ' previous record of 3,393 points by 53 points and broke the record in the fourth quarter. [ 23 ] Plum led her Washington Huskies to a 29-6 record during her senior season, which boasted a record of 15-3 in the Pac-12. Plum, along with her third seeded Washington Huskies, made it to the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament where they were knocked out by two seed Mississippi State. According to ESPN.com, Plum was unanimously selected as an Associated Press All-American First Teamer, an honor only given to five players in women's college basketball. Plum averaged 31.7 points while shooting 53 percent from the floor and 43 percent from three-point range during her senior campaign. Plum ended her senior season with a total of 1,109 points scored, an NCAA women's basketball single season record. According to Excelle Sports, Plum broke the NCAA career free throw record, tallying 912 points from the free throw line throughout her illustrious career. Plum has also been named one of the five finalists for the Wooden Award, an award handed out to the best player in women's college basketball, in the eyes of 250 sportscasters and writers. Plum was also named the AP player of the year for women's college basketball, the first ever Washington Husky to earn the award. Other accolades Plum accumulated during her senior year include being a part of the all-Pac-12 team as well as winning the Pac-12 player of the year award, only the second husky ever to win the award, according to The Seattle Times' website. Plum also earned the Nancy Lieberman award, an honor given to the top point guard in women's college basketball, as well as the Dawn Staley award, handed out to the best guard in women's college basketball. Plum ended her outstanding career with a point total of 3,527 and an assist total of 519. She finished just 270 points shy of Pete Maravich 's all-time scoring record regardless of gender. Plum graduated from Washington in June 2017 with a bachelor's degree in anthropology and a 3.3 GPA. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] On January 18, 2025, Plum's #10 jersey was retired during the half-time of Washington's game against Purdue. [ 26 ] Professional career [ edit ] WNBA [ edit ] San Antonio Stars / Las Vegas Aces (2017-2024) [ edit ] Plum with the Las Vegas Aces in 2019 Plum was selected as the first pick of the 2017 WNBA draft by the San Antonio Stars . [ 27 ] This marked the first time in history that the first overall pick from the NBA ( Markelle Fultz ) and the WNBA came from the same school ( University of Washington ) in the same year. [ 28 ] Plum made her career debut on May 25, 2017, against the Dallas Wings , she scored four points along with one assist off the bench in a 94-82 loss. [ 29 ] On August 5, 2017, Plum scored a career-high 23 points in an 87-80 overtime win against the Seattle Storm . [ 30 ] By the end of the season, Plum averaged 8.5 ppg and was voted on the All-Rookie Team, but the Stars finished with the second worst record in the league. In 2018, the San Antonio Stars relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada , and were renamed the Las Vegas Aces . In the 2018 season, Plum improved in every statistical category, averaging more points, rebounds and assists with higher shooting percentages. This helped the Aces improve overall from the previous season but they fell short of a playoff spot as they finished ninth place with a 14-20 record (6 wins better than the 2017 season). In 2019, the Aces would finish the season as the number four seed with a 21-13 record, making the playoffs for the first time since 2014. They would receive a bye to the second round. In the playoffs, Plum would step up on the offensive end, averaging double-digits in ppg for the entire Aces playoff run. In the second round elimination game, the Aces defeated the Chicago Sky 93-92 off a desperation half-court game winner by teammate Dearica Hamby who came up with a steal on defence in the final 10 seconds of the game. In the semi-finals, the Aces would lose in four games to the Washington Mystics , who ended up winning the championship. On May 15, 2020, Plum signed a two-year extension with the Aces worth $350K. [ 31 ] In early June, 2020, she suffered an injury to her Achilles tendon. Due to the injury and the surgery to repair it, she missed the 2020 season. [ 32 ] Without Plum, the Aces were 18-4 in the shortened 22-game season with the number 1 seed. They would advance all the way to the Finals but fell short by losing to the Seattle Storm in a three-game sweep. In 2021, Plum came off the bench and had a career year averaging 14.8 points, 3.6 assists, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.0 steals on 38.6% from the three and 94.4% from the free throw line. Plum ended the month of September averaging 21.7 points, 3.2 assists, and 1.5 steals, and was named Western Conference Player of the Month. [ 33 ] Plum was finally healthy and had a career revamp season coming off the bench winning the WNBA Sixth Player of the Year and finished second in the WNBA Most Improved Player voting. [ 34 ] In 2022, Plum in a now starting role averaged a new career high in points, assist, and rebounds. 20.2 points, 5.1 assists, and 2.7 rebounds on 42% from three and 46% from the field. On June 22, Plum was announced to her first All-Star team as well as being voted a starter for the All-Star Game. She then signed a two-year contract extension with Las Vegas worth $185k for one year and $200k the other year. [ 35 ] On July 10, she scored 30 points in the All-Star Game en route to being named the game's MVP . [ 36 ] She grabbed Western Conference Player of the week two times for the weeks of May 30-June 5 [ 37 ] and July 28-July 31. [ 38 ] Plum would go on to help the Aces to their second finals appearance and win their first championship in franchise history. [ 39 ] Los Angeles Sparks (2025-present) [ edit ] Plum was involved in a three-team trade between the Las Vegas Aces, the Los Angeles Sparks , and the Seattle Storm , which resulted in Plum being traded to the Sparks for the 2025 season . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] KBSL [ edit ] Fenerbahçe [ edit ] Plum with Fenerbahçe in October 2017 In 2017, Plum signed with Fenerbahçe of the Women's Basketball Super League (KBSL) in Turkey for the 2017-18 season. [ 42 ] During her first stint with the team, Plum would help the team win the KBSL championship title. She returned with Fenerbahçe for the 2018-19 season , helping the team win another KBSL championship and the Turkish Women's Basketball Cup . [ 43 ] Galatasaray [ edit ] On 15 January 2022, she signed with Galatasaray of the KBSL. [ 44 ] In 6 games in the KBSL, she averaged 26.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists.

[ 48 ] Pan American team 2015 [ edit ] Plum was injured in December, but cleared to continue playing through the season. After the season she underwent surgery on April 6. Her original dates for clearance to play extended beyond the Pan Am team trial date, but her rehabilitation went well, and she was cleared to return to the court two days before the Pan Am team trials. [ 49 ] She has been named a member of the twelve player squad representing the US to play Basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto which will be held from July 16 to 25 at the Ryerson Athletic Centre . [ 50 ] Plum was a member of the USA Women's Pan American Team which participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto , Ontario, Canada July 10 to 26, 2015. The USA opened preliminary play with a game against Brazil. Although they opened up a 16-point lead in the second quarter Brazil came back, going on a 14-0 run to take a two-point lead in the third quarter. The USA responded with an 11-2 run with foul shot contributions by Jefferson and a three-point basket from Stewart. The USA ended up winning the close game 75-69. [ 51 ] The second game was against the Dominican Republic. USA scored the first eight points and was never threatened. USA won 94-55. Plum led the team with five assists. [ 52 ] The final preliminary game USA played Puerto Rico. USA led by only three points at the end of the third quarter, largely due to the play of Carla Cortijo who scored 24 points, but left with an injury late in the game. After the injury the US extended the lead to 18 points and ended up with a 93-77 win, good for first place in their group. [ 53 ] In the semifinal game, Cuba led the US by as many as 14 points in the third quarter. The USA battled back and took a late lead. With under eight seconds to go, the USA was down by one point while Cuba had the ball. Linnae Harper stole the ball and made two free throws to give the USA the lead. Cuba missed its final shot to give the USA the win 65-64, propelling them into the gold-medal game against Canada. [ 54 ] The gold-medal game matched up the host team Canada against USA. After trading baskets early, the US edged out to a double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians fought back and tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter, Canada outscored the US 26-15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The USA would fight back, but not all the way and Canada won the game and the gold-medal 81-73. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] 2020 Summer Olympics [ edit ] In late March 2020, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government postponed the 2020 Summer Olympics until the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Williams completed her high school basketball career at Charlton County High School . She signed with the University of South Florida and enrolled at the school in the fall of 2012. [ 1 ] Early life [ edit ] Williams grew up in Folkston, Georgia, a town with under 5,000 people. In her childhood she slept with a basketball and said she wanted to play in the WNBA. [ 2 ] Her father said that she ""didn't play with dolls or any of that growing up. She was jumping on my dirt bike, riding four-wheelers. Mostly, though, she was hanging with the fellas out there on the court banging and balling."" [ 3 ] She played basketball for the Indians at Charlton County High School . Her mother Michelle Williams (then Michelle Granger) [ 4 ] also played basketball for the same high school 22 years earlier. Michelle set the single-game scoring record when she scored 40 points. In her junior season, Williams took over the record by scoring 42 points in a game. [ 5 ] She later broke her own record by scoring 44 points in a game. [ 2 ] Williams credits her father, Donald Williams, with challenging her athletically too. [ 6 ] Her father advised her to develop her midrange because of her smaller size in high school. ""My daddy told me to get a little middy so I wouldn't get hurt,"" [Williams] said with a laugh. ""It kind of became my identity."" [ 7 ] Her father also wouldn't let her play basketball for her high school during her sophomore year as punishment for sneaking out of the house to spend time with someone he thought was trouble. Her mother let her continue to play AAU basketball that year. [ 2 ] In her senior year, she led her team to the state semifinals. In the quarterfinals she scored 47 points. [ 2 ] She was named to the first team for all state in Georgia but was left off the senior all-star game. [ 2 ] College career [ edit ] Williams was a solid role player coming off the bench in her first season with the South Florida Bulls . she appeared in every game and started in 3. She averaged 7.4 points, 3.4 rebounds and .88 assists over 33 games. [ 1 ] In William's sophomore year she averaged 30.4 minutes a game compared to her 15.3 coming off the bench the season before. She finished the year with 16.3 points a game along with 7.5 rebounds and 2.4 assists. She was named All-Conference First team and was an Honorable Mention for the All-American team. [ 1 ] She was a starter in every game her junior season and averaged 20.3 points per game which led the AAC. Overall she was the ninth leading scorer in the country with 20 or more points in 20 different games. During one stretch of 10 game she scored over 20 points in each game which is the longest streak in the nation at the time. [ 1 ] In her senior year Williams hit 308 field goals which was second in the nation among all Division I teams. She scored 763 points which was eighth best among all Division I players. [ 8 ] Williams was inducted into the University of South Florida Athletic Hall of Fame in 2019 and her number 10 jersey is retired by the team. University of Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma said of Williams, ""She was just a really difficult match up for anybody and I don't think there's anybody in college who really had an answer for her on a regular basis."" [ 2 ] Professional career [ edit ] Williams playing for the Minnesota Lynx during the 2024 WNBA Finals WNBA [ edit ] Phoenix Mercury [ edit ] Williams was selected as the eighth overall pick by the Phoenix Mercury in the 2016 WNBA draft . She was surprised by the selection since she didn't have many pre draft discussions with the Mercury. Williams has identified Diana Taurasi as a player who ""I look up to and who I compare my mentality to"", and now she will be playing on the same team as Taurasi. [ 9 ] After appearing in a handful of games for the Mercury, Williams was traded to the Connecticut Sun on June 26, 2016. [ 10 ] Connecticut Sun (2016-2019) [ edit ] Geno Auriemma encouraged the Sun coach Curt Miller to give Williams a chance as a player who could go out and get points; ""There's nobody that I know that can stop her from doing that.'"" [ 2 ] Williams helped the Sun reach the WNBA Finals during the 2019 season, before they ultimately lost to the Washington Mystics . During the 2019 season, Williams was also honored by the league with a Player of the Week nod. [ 11 ] Atlanta Dream (2020-2021) [ edit ] On February 19, 2020, Williams was traded to the Atlanta Dream as part of a three-team trade. [ 12 ] Williams went on to earn her first All-Star appearance with the Dream in 2021.

[ 14 ] Connecticut Sun (2022) [ edit ] The Connecticut Sun re-signed Williams for the 2022 WNBA season. [ 15 ] Chicago Sky (2023) [ edit ] On February 4, 2023, the Chicago Sky announced the signing of Williams. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, per team policy. [ 16 ] The Sky asked Williams to switch to playing point guard. Although she was reluctant to begin with, she finished the season fourth in the league in assists per game.

[ 19 ] After the October 4, 2024, semifinals Lynx win over the Connecticut Sun , Cheryl Reeve said that Williams's ""way with this team is exactly what was missing from our team last year. The toughness, the swag, the dog, and all of those things, the belief. But not just in her ability to score the ball, but also her ability to play make to make our team better."" [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Reeve has had Williams playing the point guard position, a new role for Williams that started with her play for the Chicago Sky. [ 7 ] [ 22 ] Williams' trash talk was noted in the semifinals against the Sun, but she says her style is to remain light. [ 23 ] Williams is known for her midrange shooting; she leads the WNBA in midrange attempts with 6.9 per game, while shooting 46.2%. [ 7 ] In the 2024 season, 57.5% of her points were made in the midrange. [ 17 ] In the October 8, 2024, game 5 semifinals Lynx win against the Connecticut Sun, Williams ""had her most points in a playoff game since 2019"" with 24 points; she also had seven assists, five rebounds, and two steals. [ 24 ] Williams's four-point play with 5.5 seconds remaining In Game 1 of the finals against the New York Liberty on October 10, 2024, Williams became only the second in Lynx franchise history to have 20+ points, 5+ rebounds, and 5+ assists in back-to-back playoffs games. Maya Moore had been the only Lynx player to do that before Williams. [ 25 ] Williams played a clutch role for the team in their historic comeback win by scoring 8 of the last 10 points in regulation and 5 of the last 7 in overtime. [ 26 ] Her four-point play with 5.5 seconds left in the game gave the Lynx their first lead. [ 26 ] International play [ edit ] On August 10, 2017, Williams signed with the Perth Lynx for the 2017-18 WNBL season .

The following week, Williams was named WNBL Player of the Week, after tallying 37 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists across a pair of victories. Williams was a key contributor in the Perth Lynx's historic 14 game winning streak, resulting in the team finishing the regular season on top of the ladder. Williams finished the WNBL regular season averaging 21.7 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 4.1 APG, 2.25 STPG and 0.9 BLKPG. [ 28 ] Athletes Unlimited [ edit ] Williams played for Athletes Unlimited in the 2022 season. [ 29 ] Unrivaled [ edit ] On October 9, 2024, Unrivaled announced that Williams would play in the inaugural 2025 season for the new league. [ 30 ] She was selected for Lunar Owls .

She started playing as an amateur in the German second division, and later in the 1. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga . Retaining her NCAA eligibility , she moved to the US in 2017 and played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks . During her three years with Oregon, Sabally contributed to the Ducks winning three regular-season and two tournament Pac-12 championships, and reaching their first-ever NCAA tournament Final Four in 2019. After her junior season, she entered the 2020 WNBA draft and was selected second overall by the Dallas Wings . Sabally spent five seasons with the Wings, winning the WNBA Most Improved Player Award and earning an All-WNBA First Team nomination in 2023, and becoming a two-time All-Star (2021, 2023). In 2025, she was traded to the Phoenix Mercury. Sabally has represented the senior German national team since 2019. She helped Germany qualify to the 2024 Olympic tournament , the first-ever appearance for the women's basketball team. Early life [ edit ] Sabally was born in New York City to a Gambian father, Jerreh, and German mother, Heike, and is the third of seven children. [ 1 ] Her given name of Isatou is that of her father's sister; according to Sabally, the name is derived from that of Aisha , one of the wives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . While Gambian tradition normally calls for a family's oldest daughter to receive an aunt's name, she was so named despite not being the oldest daughter. [ 2 ] The family moved to Gambia when she was 2 years old, and then moved to Berlin when she was preparing to start school. She was discovered by a local coach as a 9-year-old at a playground and began regularly attending practices. She was the only girl on her first youth team. [ 3 ] In 2012, Sabally joined the Berlin basketball club TuS Lichterfelde of the 2. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga, and played there until 2015. [ 4 ] After her sophomore year of high school, she moved from Berlin to attend the Rotteck Gymnasium in Freiburg. She then joined the professional team Eisvögel USC Freiburg of the 1. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga and played there from 2015 to 2017. However, in order to keep her NCAA eligibility, she did not take a salary and retained her amateur status. [ 5 ] Sabally played in the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic , being the first international player to play in the girls' game. [ 1 ] College career [ edit ] 2017-18: Freshman season [ edit ] During her first year at Oregon , Sabally appeared in every game for the Ducks while averaging 10.7 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. She was named to the Pac-12 all-Freshman team and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. [ 6 ] Oregon won the Pac-12 regular-season title as well as, for the first time in school history, the Pac-12 Tournament championship . In the NCAA tournament , they advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost to the eventual champions, Notre Dame . [ 7 ] 2018-19: Sophomore season [ edit ] In her second season , Sabally started all 38 games and was the third most efficient player in NCAA. Oregon won their second straight Pac-12 regular-season title, and made their first-ever Final Four in the NCAA tournament , where they lost to Baylor . [ 8 ] Following the season, Sabally was named to the Pac-12 team, an honorable mention All-American by the WBCA , and to the watchlist for both the Naismith Trophy and Wade Trophy. [ 6 ] 2019-20: Junior season [ edit ] In her junior season , Sabally started in 29 games, missing three in November due to her obligations with the Germany national team . [ 9 ] However, she still played in the November 9, 2019, exhibition against the United States women's national basketball team , where her 25 points helped Oregon secure a 93-86 victory. Oregon became only the second college squad in history to beat the US national team. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Despite having one remaining season of college eligibility, Sabally announced in February 2020 that she would enter the 2020 WNBA draft ; she was draft-eligible because she reached the league's minimum age of 22 [ a ] shortly after the April draft. [ 13 ] Oregon won their third straight Pac-12 regular-season title as well as the Pac-12 Tournament championship and was ranked No. 2 with a 31-2 record when the season was prematurely ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Following the season, Sabally won the Cheryl Miller Award for the best small forward in the country, was named to the watchlist for both the Naismith Trophy and Wade Trophy, was named to the Pac-12 team, and was a consensus all-American (WBCA First-Team All-America, AP and USBWA Second-Team All-America). She finished her college career at No. 7 on the Oregon all-time scoring list with 1,508 career points. [ 6 ] Professional career [ edit ] WNBA [ edit ] Dallas Wings (2020-2024) [ edit ] Sabally was selected as the second overall pick in the 2020 WNBA draft by the Dallas Wings . [ 2 ] In her rookie season , which was played in the Wubble , a back issue and concussion limited her to 16 of 22 regular-season games. At the end of the season, she was named to the 2020 WNBA All-Rookie Team . [ 16 ] In her second season , Sabally missed the first six regular-season games while playing in the 2021 FIBA 3x3 Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament with Germany. Her performance after her return earned her a nomination to the 2021 WNBA All-Star Game . However, Sabally missed most of the games after the Olympic break due to nagging Achilles soreness, and she ended up playing in only 17 of 32 regular-season games. [ 17 ] The Wings made the playoffs as the seventh seed, but lost in the first round to the eventual champions, the Chicago Sky . Sabally played in only 11 regular-season games in the 2022 WNBA season , initially missing games due to a late arrival from her season with Fenerbahçe , and later due to knee and ankle injuries. [ 18 ] The Wings finished with a .500 or better record for the first time since relocating to Dallas and made the 2022 WNBA Playoffs as the sixth seed. They faced the third-seeded Connecticut Sun in the first round of the playoffs and won their first playoff game as a franchise since 2009, but eventually lost the series 1-2. Sabally, having missed the last 13 games of the regular season, returned for the playoffs but did not start any of the games and averaged only 15 minutes off the bench. [ 19 ] After struggling with injuries through her first three seasons, which limited her to only 44 appearances, Sabally had a breakthrough year in the 2023 WNBA season . She started 38 games, achieved career-high averages in points, rebounds, assists and steals, was named a 2023 WNBA All-Star Game starter, won the WNBA Most Improved Player Award , and finished fifth in the WNBA Most Valuable Player Award voting. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] On June 11, in a game against the New York Liberty , Sabally played against her sister Nyara for the first time in their careers. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] They became the fifth set of sisters to play against each other in WNBA history. [ 24 ] On June 13, she earned her first career WNBA Player of the Week honor. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] On July 28, in a 90-62 win over the Washington Mystics , Sabally recorded the second triple-double in Wings franchise history (and first since relocating to Dallas) with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists. [ 27 ] Sabally led the Wings to their first winning record since relocating to Dallas, earning them the fourth seed in the 2023 WNBA Playoffs . The Wings defeated the Atlanta Dream 2-0 in the first round and made their first franchise WNBA semifinal since 2009. They lost 0-3 in the semifinal to the eventual champions, the Las Vegas Aces . With her rookie contract expiring after the 2023 season, Sabally became a restricted free agent. In January 2024, Sabally signed a one-year deal with the Wings worth $195,000, taking slightly less money than she was eligible for in order to help the team's chances. [ 28 ] However, Sabally missed the first 25 games of the 2024 WNBA season due to a shoulder injury sustained on national team duty. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Dallas, plagued with injuries to other players as well, struggled in her absence. [ 31 ] Sabally started in all 15 games for the Wings after the Olympic break and posted new career-highs in assists and three-point field goal percentage, but it was a disappointing season for the team, which finished 11th with a 9-31 record. [ 32 ] On January 9, 2025, Sabally announced that she had already played her last game in Dallas and would be seeking a new team. [ 33 ] Set to become an unrestricted free agent, she received the core designation from the Wings, granting them exclusive negotiating rights with her. Both sides then worked together to find a suitable trade. [ 34 ] Phoenix Mercury (2025-present) [ edit ] On February 2, 2025, a four-team trade among the Dallas Wings, Connecticut Sun, Indiana Fever, and Phoenix Mercury was finalized. The deal sent Sabally and her Wings teammates Kalani Brown and Sevgi Uzun to the Mercury, along with perennial All-Star Alyssa Thomas from the Sun. [ 35 ] Due to being originally cored by the Wings, Sabally was eligible for supermax money, but she signed a one-year contract worth $215,000. [ 36 ] In her debut--an 81-59 win over the Seattle Storm--Sabally scored 27 points, setting a new record for the most points scored by a Mercury player in their team debut.

Sabally was named to the All-EuroLeague Women Second Team in 2020-2021 and the All-EuroLeague Women First Team in 2021-2022.

[ 40 ] She was assigned to Phantom , reuniting with her former Oregon teammate Sabrina Ionescu. [ 41 ] In the 2025 Unrivaled season , Sabally played in all 14 games, starting 13, and averaged 15.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game.

The next year, she helped Germany win the 2014 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship for Women Division B and earn a promotion to Division A. Sabally averaged 13.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game and was named MVP of the tournament.

[ 45 ] Senior national team [ edit ] Sabally played for the Germany women's national 3x3 team at the 2019 European Games in Minsk . [ 46 ] In May 2021, she participated in the 2021 FIBA 3x3 Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament , where Germany finished 10th and failed to qualify. Sabally played for the senior Germany women's national basketball team in the EuroBasket Women 2021 qualification . She appeared in two games in November 2019, against North Macedonia (later declared void [ 47 ] ) and Croatia , where she was the top scorer in both. Sabally returned to the national team in November 2023 for the first two games of the EuroBasket Women 2025 qualification . The first game of the qualification, a win against Czechia , was the first time Satou played together with her sister Nyara in the senior national team. [ 48 ] In February 2024, Sabally played in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belém . She suffered a shoulder injury during the first game, a surprising victory over Serbia , [ 49 ] and did not play in the second game, a loss to Australia . She returned to the lineup for the final decisive game against Brazil , where she was named Player of the Game as Germany secured the win and qualified to the Olympic tournament for the first time. [ 50 ] Right after the qualification tournament, Sabally underwent surgery to repair her shoulder injury, ruling her out of the pre-Olympic part of the 2024 WNBA season . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Sabally returned to play at the Paris Olympic tournament, helping the German team reach the quarterfinals in their first Olympic appearance.

Nonetheless, she was named to the All-Second Team of the tournament, averaging 18.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 2.0 assists over four games. [ 53 ] Player profile [ edit ] Sabally is a versatile forward who offers an unusual combination of ball-handling, shooting skills, and size, which earned her the nickname ""Unicorn"". [ 2 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Sabally's play has drawn comparisons to the men's basketball player Kristaps Porziņģis , who has been given the same nickname and popularized the term ""unicorn"" in basketball.

Magbegor was a member of the Australian Women's basketball team (Opals) at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics . The Opals were eliminated after losing to the US in the quarterfinals. [ 1 ] She was part of the Australian team that won bronze at the 2024 Paris Olympics . Professional career [ edit ] WNBL [ edit ] After beginning her career in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) with Basketball Australia 's development team, the Centre of Excellence, Magbegor did not take long to gain attention from professional leagues. In July 2017, Magbegor was signed by the Canberra Capitals for the 2017-18 WNBL season . [ 2 ] In March 2018, it was announced that Magbegor had signed a three-year deal with the Melbourne Boomers . [ 3 ] Magbegor first suited up for the Boomers in the 2018-19 WNBL season , choosing to stay home in Australia working alongside the likes of Jenna O'Hea , Lauren Jackson and Guy Molloy despite several offers from US colleges. In February 2020, Magbegor was named the Betty Watson Australian Youth Player of the Year (formerly the WNBL Rookie of the Year award) at the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) Awards, scoring 38 votes from a possible tally of 42 votes. [ 4 ] In April 2022, Magbegor was part of the Melbourne Boomers championship team before moving to play basketball next season in Hungary [ 5 ] WNBA [ edit ] Seattle Storm (2020-present) [ edit ] Magbegor was selected 12th overall by the Seattle Storm in the 2019 WNBA draft . At just 19 years old, she did not come over for the 2019 WNBA season , as both she and the Storm preferred that she remain in Australia to continue her development. [ 6 ] Magbegor joined the Storm for the 2020 WNBA season , which was played in the Wubble . [ 7 ] In her rookie season , on a team with championship ambitions, Magbegor had a limited role. She averaged 13.3 minutes, 6.5 points, and 2.5 rebounds per game in the regular season, while shooting 56.9% from the floor, the ninth-best in the league. During the Storm's playoff run, she played only 35 minutes as the team went on to win the championship. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Magbegor became the second-youngest player in history to win a WNBA championship. [ 10 ] In her second season with the Storm, Magbegor's role slightly increased, and she started three games in the regular season. The Storm won the inaugural WNBA Commissioner's Cup and finished fourth in the regular season standings. However, they were unable to replicate their previous playoff success, losing to the Phoenix Mercury in a second-round single-elimination game. In that matchup, Magbegor made her first career playoff start, as Seattle was without their star forward Breanna Stewart due to injury. [ 11 ] In her third season with the Storm, Magbegor became a regular starter, starting in 23 games and averaging 24.8 minutes per game. However, she eventually lost her starting spot to midseason signing Tina Charles . In the playoffs, Magbegor's playing time decreased to an average of 15.5 minutes per game as the Storm fell to the eventual champions Las Vegas Aces 1-3 in the semifinals. Nonetheless, it was a successful season for Magbegor who was named to the WNBA All-Defensive Second Team for the first time in her career. [ 12 ] Before the 2023 season, Magbegor signed a two-year deal with the Storm. [ 13 ] With Seattle losing Breanna Stewart and Tina Charles to free agency, and Sue Bird to retirement, the 2023 Seattle Storm season marked the start of a new chapter. Magbegor took on an undisputed starting role, starting all 40 games and averaging 32.6 minutes per game. She posted career-highs in all statistical categories and earned her first-ever selection to the WNBA All-Star Game . Magbegor was also named to the WNBA All-Defensive Second Team for the second consecutive season. [ 14 ] Despite her individual success, the Storm, with a much younger and less experienced roster, struggled and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2015. For the 2024 season , the Storm significantly strengthened their roster by signing star free agents Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith . Alongside these two and Jewell Loyd , Magbegor formed what the team marketed as the ""Core Four."" [ 15 ] In June, Magbegor signed a one-year contract extension with the Storm. [ 16 ] She started 37 games in the regular season, missing only the final three due to a concussion. As a result of being in the concussion protocol, she also missed the first playoff game against the Aces. [ 17 ] Although she returned for the second game, her efforts could not prevent another loss, which led to the Storm's elimination from the playoffs. [ 18 ] Despite her solid performances, Magbegor was not selected for the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game , a decision ESPN's Kevin Pelton described as ""the most egregious omission ever."" [ 19 ] However, she received three votes for the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Award [ 20 ] and was named to the WNBA All-Defensive First Team for the first time in her career. [ 21 ] National team career [ edit ] Youth level [ edit ] Magbegor made her international debut at the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Russia , with the U19 Gems as a 16 year old. She then represented the U17 Sapphires at the 2015 Oceania Championships. Dominating the tournament, averaging 18 points per game and helping Australia take home Gold. Magbegor then lead the Sapphires to their inaugural World Championship title in Spain . After snapping team USA's 28-game win streak at U17 level, Australia went on to take home Gold. Alongside two of her teammates, Magbegor was named to the All-Tournament Team. In addition to this, she received the Most Valuable Player award. [ 22 ] Senior level [ edit ] In December 2017, Magbegor was named to her first Opals squad, earning her a place in the first camp as preparations for this years upcoming tournaments got underway. [ 23 ] After taking part in the team camp in February, Magbegor was then named to the final roster for the 2018 Commonwealth Games where she would make her Opals debut. [ 24 ] Magbegor starred for the Opals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, having a standout game in Australia's win against the US in a pre-tournament friendly with 17 points, equal most in the game with Breanna Stewart . Magbegor then top scored for Australia during the Olympic tournament with 20 points and eight rebounds in the game against Belgium (her Olympic debut), and 15 points against China. [ 25 ] Magbegor, like all the other members of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Opals women's basketball team, had a difficult tournament. The Opals lost their first two group stage matches. They looked flat against Belgium and then lost to China in heartbreaking circumstances. In their last group match the Opals needed to beat Puerto Rico by 25 or more in their final match to progress. This they did by 27 in a very exciting match. However, they lost to the United States in their quarterfinal 79 to 55. [ 26 ] Magbegor returned to the spotlight at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris . The Opals won the bronze medal with a win over Belgium. Magbegor starred in that match, scoring 30 points on 71 percent shooting, while also contributing 13 rebounds, three blocks, three assists and two steals. Her performance won her credit for both her offensive and defensive achievement.

[ 1 ] She was drafted 4th overall by the Chicago Sky in the 2018 WNBA draft . In 2022 she was a EuroLeague champion with Sopron and was named the Final Four MVP. Williams played forward in college for the UConn Huskies , and won back to back national championships in 2015 and 2016 . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] She has played for the French national team in the Tokyo 2020 and the Paris 2024 Olympic games. Personal life [ edit ] Williams was raised in Sparks, Nevada by her father Matthew, who is American , and mother Thérèse, who is French . Williams is fluent in the French language , having grown up speaking it with her grandmother, and maintains both American and French citizenship. [ 5 ] She started being taught French at age six by her grandmother, Angela Bishop from Paris, who lived just down the street from her. [ 6 ] High school [ edit ] Basketball [ edit ] Williams attended and played basketball at Edward C. Reed High School [ 7 ] in Sparks, Nevada . As a sophomore she averaged 18 points, 10 rebounds, and seven steals per game in leading Reed to the Class 4A state title. Williams had 15 points, 14 rebounds, and six assists in a semifinal win over Foothill, then had 24 points, four rebounds, and four assists in the championship game win over Reno and was named the Las Vegas Review-Journal Class 4A state Player of the Year. During her junior year, Williams was averaging 30 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, and seven blocked shots per game when she suffered a completely torn anterior cruciate ligament and partially-torn meniscus in her right knee on Jan. 19 just 30-seconds into a game against rival Reno High. [ 8 ] She had season-ending surgery Feb. 11 and was cleared to return to full basketball activity Oct. 10. Track and field [ edit ] Williams was a very accomplished multi-event track and field athlete. She was named the Gatorade Nevada Girls Track & Field Athlete of the Year, honoring the best track and field athlete in high school while still a freshman. She competed in the state meet, finishing second in the 100 meter hurdles and third in the 300 meter hurdles as well as helping the 4 x 400 meter relay team finish second. She cleared 5'8"" in the high jump, which ranked number 36 among all high school players in the nation. As a sophomore, she repeated as the Gatorade Nevada Girls Track & Field Athlete of the Year. At the state championships, she won the 100 meter hurdles as well as the 300 meter hurdles and cleared 5'11"" to win the high jump. At a regional meet she cleared 6 feet 1.5 inches, which ranked as the top performance among high school competitors at the time and was second best among all of Division I. At the Olympic trials in 2012, she cleared 6 feet 2 + 1 ⁄ 4 inches to finish in fifth place among all competitors, while still too young to be eligible for the US world Junior team, although she qualified as an alternate for the 2012 London Olympics . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] College [ edit ] University of Connecticut [ edit ] Williams (#15) in 2017 Williams helped UConn reach a 148-3 record over her four-year career, which included four Final Four appearances and back to back National Championships. She had one of only five Huskies triple-doubles in school history. She is one of only nine Huskies with at least 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. Williams finished her career 22nd on UConn's all-time scoring list at 1,582 career points, seventh with 1,007 career rebounds, 13th in assists (481) and fifth in steals (305). Williams was named the 2017 American Athletic Conference and WBCA NCAA Division I Defensive Player of the Year and 2018 Lowe's Senior Class Award. [ 9 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] 2017- United States Basketball Writers Association All-America Team [ 14 ] 2017- WBCA Defensive Player of the Year 2017-AP All-American second team [ 15 ] 2017- AAC Defensive Player of the Year [ 16 ] 2017-NCAA Tournament - All Tournament Team [ 17 ] Professional career [ edit ] WNBA [ edit ] Williams in 2018 Williams was drafted 4th overall in the 2018 WNBA draft by the Chicago Sky . On May 9, 2021, it was announced that Williams was traded to the Los Angeles Sparks . On February 3, 2022, Williams was acquired by the Seattle Storm in a trade that sent Katie Lou Samuelson , and the 9th overall pick in 2022 WNBA draft to the Sparks . [ 18 ] European career [ edit ] In 2018, Williams signed with Dike Basket Napoli of the Italian First Division . [ 19 ] In January 2019, after week 14, her team withdrew from the championships. [ 20 ] Williams signed to Spar CityLift Girona in late February 2019 to replace Shay Murphy , who left the team for family reasons and returned to the United States . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] With Girona , she won the 2018-19 Spanish First Division . [ 23 ] Sopron Basket [ edit ] On 15 May 2020, Williams signed to Sopron Basket with former UConn teammate Megan Walker . [ 24 ] On April 10, 2022, Williams won the 2021-22 EuroLeague Women championship with Sopron Basket , while being named Final Four MVP after the final. [ 25 ] ASVEL Féminin [ edit ] On 15 June 2022, Williams signed to LDLC ASVEL . [ 26 ] In 2023, she won the Eurocup as well as the French championship with ASVEL. Her second season at ASVEL (2023-24) was shadowed by an injury and the death of her father. [ 27 ] Fenerbahçe [ edit ] Williams inked a deal with Fenerbahçe S.K. in July 2024. [ 27 ] Olympics [ edit ] Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021) [ edit ] Although Williams was born and raised in the United States , her mother is French and she has extended family living in France , so she qualified for inclusion on the French national team. [ 28 ] Her Olympic experience was not her first experience with the French team, as she played for Les Bleues in the 2021 Eurobasket competition , helping the team to win silver. [ 29 ] Williams averaged 8.2 points per game in that competition. [ 30 ] The decision to play for the Olympic team was not without cost. Many of the Olympic players, not just for the USA, but for several other teams, play in the WNBA , whose regular-season typically runs through the summer months. To accommodate the Olympics , the WNBA typically takes a month-long break in the season during Olympic years; however, Williams's commitments to the French national team interfered with her ability to show up at training camp for the Chicago Sky . She told ESPN 's Michael Voepel that she thought she had reached an understanding with the team regarding her commitments, but the team disagreed, suspended her from the team and traded her to the Los Angeles Sparks . She was a member of the Sparks after the Olympics were over, but because she was suspended, she was ineligible to play during the season, so her decision to play for the French national team cost her an entire WNBA season. [ 31 ] In the opening game of the preliminary rounds, France faced Japan. France was ranked fifth in the world at the time while Japan was 10th, [ 32 ] but Japan was playing in their home country, and they upset France 74-70. Williams played 31 minutes, more than any other player on her team. France was allocated to group B, which also included the USA and Nigeria. While France could advance even with a loss to the USA, they would not advance to the knockout stage if they lost to Nigeria, so they found themselves in a must win situation in just their second game. France ""righted the ship .. against Nigeria"", winning 87-62. [ 33 ] Williams had 13 points and nine rebounds (tied for top on the team), just missing a double double. She also led the team in steals. [ 33 ] In the game against the United States, which had not lost an Olympic game since 1992, the Americans again prevailed, but France kept the game close, finally losing 93-82. Voepel noted that Williams was called a "" Swiss Army knife "" due to her versatility. [ 34 ] She was the only member of the French team to record results in five statistical categories: points (10), rebounds (5), assists (3), steals (6), and blocks (1). In the knockout round, France faced Spain and just managed to come away with a win, 67-64. Williams was one of two French players with double-digit scoring, recording 11 points in 29 minutes. The semi-final match was against Japan, who had never won an Olympic medal, but was now playing for a chance to make it to the gold-medal game on their home territory. Japan won 87-71. Williams played a team-high 26 minutes and recorded eight rebounds, more than any other player on either team. In the bronze medal game, France faced Serbia, who had beaten France for the Eurobasket championship less than two months earlier. [ 29 ] Serbia started out strong, and led 23-19 at the end of the first quarter. France battled back, taking the lead with less than a minute left in the half. They never relinquished the lead and ended up winning by 15 points, 91-76. [ 33 ] While Williams had played well up to this point, she saved her best for last, hitting four of her five three-point attempts, tying for the team lead in assists and the only player on her team to record a block and a steal in the game. [ 33 ] She was the leading scorer for her team with 17 points. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Paris 2024 [ edit ] Williams was again named to the French national team for the 2024 Olympics , [ 37 ] winning a silver medal in the tournament. Heading into the final game against the USA, Williams averaged 14.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists, and 2.8 steals in France's five Olympic games while shooting 49.2% from the field. [ 38 ] She was the French team's leader in points, assists and steals for the Olympic tournament.
